Research Focus: Climate Change Impacts on Urban Heat Island

Content:
On this page: Climate change and heat islands interact in important ways. In many areas of the U.S., steadily increasing warming trends are intensifying already higher temperatures in heat island areas. 1, 2 This continued warming is expected to worsen heat islands in the future.3 As urban population densities increase and natural land areas decrease, heat islands will strengthen.3, 4 Communities can address and respond to these trends by taking actions to reduce their local heat islands. For example, strategies such as installing cool roofs and increasing tree canopy can lower heat island temperatures and lessen the exposure and sensitivity of city residents to climate change impacts, while also lowering the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change. This page describes the risks posed by the interplay of climate change and heat islands and highlights the climate change-related benefits of heat island reduction strategies. A series of unusually hot days is referred to as an extreme heat event or a heat wave. Annual heat wave counts and heat wave season length have steadily increased in U.S. cities over the past several decades (Figure 1). As global temperatures continue to rise due to climate change, heat wave frequency and severity are expected to continue to increase.5 Areas already impacted by heat islands will likely bear the brunt of these heat waves and their associated harmful health and environmental effects. These maps represent the number of heat waves per year (frequency) and the number of days between the first and last heat wave of the year (season length) compared with the local temperature threshold for defining a heat wave across 50 U.S. metropolitan areas.6 When people are exposed to extreme heat, they can suffer from potentially deadly illnesses, such as heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Hot temperatures can also contribute to deaths from heart attacks, strokes, and other forms of cardiovascular disease. Extreme heat events strain high-risk populations disproportionately. 7, 8, 9 Older adults, young children, people of color, individuals with low-income, outdoor workers, and people in poor health are the most vulnerable to these impacts. For example, Figure 2 shows the difference in death rates between some of these population groups. Using 2004–2018 data, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded 10,527 heat-related

Content:
Urban heat islands (UHIs) exacerbate the risk of heat-related mortality associated with global climate change. The intensity of UHIs varies with population size and mean annual precipitation, but a unifying explanation for this variation is lacking, and there are no geographically targeted guidelines for heat mitigation. Here we analyse summertime differences between urban and rural surface temperatures (ΔTs) worldwide and find a nonlinear increase in ΔTs with precipitation that is controlled by water or energy limitations on evapotranspiration and that modulates the scaling of ΔTs with city size. We introduce a coarse-grained model that links population, background climate, and UHI intensity, and show that urban–rural differences in evapotranspiration and convection efficiency are the main determinants of warming. The direct implication of these nonlinearities is that mitigation strategies aimed at increasing green cover and albedo are more efficient in dry regions, whereas the challenge of cooling tropical cities will require innovative solutions.

Research Focus: Water Management Strategies for Efficient Use in Coastal Areas
Source: https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/9812/chapter/11
Content:
This chapter reviews what is known about management options for reducing nutrient supply to coastal environments. It finds: Nutrient loads to coastal areas can be reduced by a variety of means, including improvements in agricultural practices, reductions in atmospheric sources of nitrogen, improvements in treatment of municipal wastewater (including tertiary treatment in some cases), and better control of diffuse urban nutrient sources such as runoff from streets and storm sewers (including both structural and passive controls). Regional stormwater control facilities, use of wetlands as nutrient sinks, better forest management to limit nitrogen export, enhancement of circulation in coastal waterways, and biological treatment also offer promise in some settings. Options to minimize nutrient export from agricultural areas include manure management strategies, careful estimation of native nutrient availability and crop requirements, and supplemental fertilizer application timed to meet crop demand. Watershed-scale implementation of best management practices needs to be targeted to ensure maximum reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus export. Post-implementation monitoring should be done to assess effectiveness. Lasting reductions in nutrient export from agriculture can be encouraged by focusing on consumer-driven programs and education, as well as on-farm production. Farmers’ decisions are often influenced by regional or even global economics. At these scales, farmers have little or no control over these economic pressures and the resulting changes in nutrient flows and distribution. New ways of using incentives to help farmers implement innovative source reduction and control are needed. A positive side effect from regulatory initiatives to reduce NOx emissions, targeted to minimize ozone and acid rain, is a reduction in the atmospheric contribution to nutrient loading in estuaries. The need to minimize coastal eutrophication should be a component of air pollution control strategies. Unfortunately, current NOx emission efforts are aimed principally at control during the summer because of emphasis on ozone and smog formation; for eutrophication, year-round emission controls are necessary. A wide variety of methods, with variable effectiveness, are available to reduce urban point and nonpoint sourced nutrients. Natural options (enhancement of coastal wetlands) are

Research Focus: The Impact of Traditional Architecture on Urban Air Quality
Source: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-74524-9
Content:
Most air pollution research has focused on assessing the urban landscape effects of pollutants in megacities, little is known about their associations in small- to mid-sized cities. Considering that the biggest urban growth is projected to occur in these smaller-scale cities, this empirical study identifies the key urban form determinants of decadal-long fine particulate matter (PM2.5) trends in all 626 Chinese cities at the county level and above. As the first study of its kind, this study comprehensively examines the urban form effects on air quality in cities of different population sizes, at different development levels, and in different spatial-autocorrelation positions. Results demonstrate that the urban form evolution has long-term effects on PM2.5 level, but the dominant factors shift over the urbanization stages: area metrics play a role in PM2.5 trends of small-sized cities at the early urban development stage, whereas aggregation metrics determine such trends mostly in mid-sized cities. For large cities exhibiting a higher degree of urbanization, the spatial connectedness of urban patches is positively associated with long-term PM2.5 level increases. We suggest that, depending on the city’s developmental stage, different aspects of the urban form should be emphasized to achieve long-term clean air goals. Air pollution represents a prominent threat to global society by causing cascading effects on individuals1, medical systems2, ecosystem health3, and economies4 in both developing and developed countries5,6,7,8. About 90% of global citizens lived in areas that exceed the safe level in the World Health Organization (WHO) air quality guidelines9. Among all types of ecosystems, urban produce roughly 78% of carbon emissions and substantial airborne pollutants that adversely affect over 50% of the world’s population living in them5,10. While air pollution affects all regions, there exhibits substantial regional variation in air pollution levels11. For instance, the annual mean concentration of fine particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of less than 2.5 \(\upmu\mathrm{m}\) (PM2.5) in the most polluted cities is nearly 20 times higher than the cleanest city according to a survey of 499 global cities12. Many factors can influence the regional air quality, including emissions, meteorology, and physicochemical transformations. Another non-negligibl

CHENNAI: The year 2023 gave us a taste of how devastating climate change impact can be, if we don’t adapt and become resilient to the new normal. Cyclone Michaung which drowned Chennai, followed by 93cm of rainfall in 24 hours in Kayalpattinam in Thoothukudi are reminders of how the future would be. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organisation has already declared 2023 as the hottest year ever recorded. Tamil Nadu is taking several measures to combat climate change, but there are gaps that need to be addressed. For instance, the ambitious Real-Time Flood Forecasting and Spatial Decision Support System for Chennai basin has been in a limbo due to issues with the contractor. Government sources told TNIE not a single piece of field equipment was installed till date. Additional Chief Secretary (Environment, Climate Change and Forests) Supriya Sahu told TNIE that individual weather events cannot be directly attributed to climate change, but increase in frequency and intensity of such events are consistent with predictions about climate change impacts. “For the government machinery to respond to such events, the state government has initiated various measures to mitigate the impact of extreme weather events. One notable initiative is the District Climate Mission, which has been launched in all 38 districts in the state,” Sahu said. Further, the government supported the operationalisation of the climate studio at the Centre for Climate Change and Disaster Management, Anna University, which has already completed the climate projections as per IPCCC AR6 reports and shared projected climate profiles of all the districts along with the projected climate risks to water, agriculture, forest, coastal ecosystem and urban habitats, she added. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu Green Climate company has initiated a study on long-term net-zero emissions transition plan with the support of CEEW. The study explored a business-as-usual scenario, by assessing the emissions trajectory of the state within the existing policy framework, and a net-zero scenario, where TN may achieve before 2070. “A pre-final assessment report indicating the strategies in reducing emissions from individual sectors would be submitted next month,” the top bureaucrat said. Shruti Narayanm, C40 Regional Director for South and West Asia, told TNIE it was important for cities to integrate climate change into their o

CHENNAI: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), in its latest report, identified Chennai among several Indian cities facing the risk of breaching the critical threshold of wet-bulb temperatures, a measure that combines heat and humidity. It says under RCP8.5 (high emissions scenario), by the end of the century, Lucknow and Patna are among the cities predicted to reach wet-bulb temperatures of 35° Celsius if emissions continue to rise, while Bhubaneswar, Chennai, Mumbai, Indore, and Ahmedabad are at risk of reaching wet-bulb temperatures of 32-34°C with continued emissions. Explaining what this means, Dr Anjal Prakash, IPCC lead author of chapters on cities and mountains, told TNIE high-resolution climate change simulations suggest that due to deadly heat waves projected in some densely-populated regions of South Asia, the critical threshold of the wet-bulb temperature of 35°C will be exceeded under the business-as-usual scenario of future greenhouse gas emissions. “It is most likely that a city like Chennai will face the double whammy of heat and humidity, and cyclones, which are also predicted to be on a rise under a 1.5-degree scenario. The impact will be directly on older people and those who have comorbidities,” he said. Climate experts say a wet-bulb temperature of 31°C is extremely dangerous for humans, 35°C is unsurvivable for more than about six hours, even for healthy adults resting in the shade. Dr Prakash, who studied in Chennai and knows the issues plaguing the city, said the Tamil Nadu government should make enhanced budgetary allocations to improve the city’s resilience and combat what is impending. “We don’t have much time. The government has to act now. The IPCC assessment is only an indicator. A State-level or district-level study should be carried out and mitigation measures should be shaped accordingly.” On Tuesday, the wet-bulb temperature for Chennai was 24.4°C. Last summer, it breached 30°C. When contacted, Additional Chief Secretary Supriya Sahu said she was aware of the IPCC projections and the State government is taking several steps to mitigate climate change. “It will be a very tall claim to say we can reverse climate change; however, major measures are in the pipeline. For Chennai, under the Tamil Nadu Green Mission, we are going to set up micro forests. I have already written to various departments to identify vaca
