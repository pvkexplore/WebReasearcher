Learn how conflicts throughout history have hindered economic growth, leading to reduced living standards and long-lasting instability. Understand the repercussions of conflict on development. EDITORIAL Muhammad Khalid Bashir 9/1/2024 Throughout history, conflict has been a persistent and formidable obstacle to economic growth. Whether arising within families, at local or regional levels, between provinces, or across national borders, conflicts disrupt the normal flow of economic activities, leading to a cascade of negative effects. These repercussions manifest in diminished economic growth, reduced living standards, and long-lasting instability that hinders development for years, if not decades. The relationship between conflict and economic growth is complex and multifaceted. Conflicts can cause immediate and severe economic disruptions by destroying infrastructure, reducing productivity, and diverting resources from productive uses. Over time, the lingering effects of conflict can be equally devastating, creating an atmosphere of uncertainty that discourages investment and innovation, undermines governance, and perpetuates poverty. However, by understanding the ways in which conflicts impact economies, we can also identify opportunities to prevent and mitigate these effects, ultimately fostering a more stable and prosperous world. The Economic Toll of Conflict 1. Family Conflicts: The Microcosm of Economic Disruption At the most basic level, conflicts within families can have significant economic consequences. Disputes over inheritance, divorce, or other domestic issues often lead to financial instability, legal expenses, and the breakdown of family businesses. When family members are embroiled in conflict, their focus shifts away from economic activities, resulting in reduced productivity and income. The economic fallout from family conflicts extends beyond the household, particularly when small businesses or farms are involved. In many rural areas, these enterprises form the backbone of local economies. When they are disrupted, the effects ripple through the community, exacerbating poverty and triggering further conflicts. This cycle of economic decline and social tension illustrates how even the smallest conflicts can have far-reaching economic implications. 2.

Research Focus: Russian Influence in Eastern Europe

Content:
The Kremlin’s activist foreign policy is expanding Russian global influence at a time when the United States and other Western countries are increasingly divided or consumed by domestic problems. The Return of Global Russia project will examine the Kremlin’s ambitions to become a player in far-flung parts of the world where its influence has long been written off, the tools it is relying upon to challenge the liberal international order, and practical Western policy options for how and when to respond to this new challenge. The war in Ukraine has left a group of “in-between” European countries more vulnerable and insecure than ever before. These countries—Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Moldova, and Serbia—find themselves in what we have termed an “arc of instability” between Russia and the European Union. This paper, a collaboration between two scholars from Carnegie Europe and one from Carnegie’s Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin, is the first of four looking at the issues facing these in-between states. It examines how Russia seeks to maintain influence and leverage in them, the weaknesses it seeks to exploit, and the changing narratives it uses to win the loyalty of swing voters and deter the West. The three subsequent publications will look in more detail at the situation in Armenia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Moldova. All of these in-between states are outside of the European Union and NATO, but are building stronger ties with the EU: several are prospective members of the union. They also maintain many connections with Russia, and are home to pro-Russian political forces and business interests. Many still buy Russian gas. Armenia is a member of two Russian-led institutions—the Eurasian Economic Union and (for now, at least) the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO)—but is in the process of reevaluating the utility of membership in these organizations. Since 2022, the EU and the United States have deployed substantial new political and economic resources to support these in-between states. The EU has relaunched its enlargement process, which had been stalled since 2013, and given candidate status to Moldova, Ukraine, and (more conditionally) Georgia—something that would have been unthinkable a little more than two years ago. It has set up the European Union Mission in Armenia (EUMA) to monitor the border, the first such mission in a c

Research Focus: Humanitarian Crisis in Ukraine
Source: https://www.unocha.org/ukraine
Content:
The war in Ukraine continues to inflict immeasurable human suffering, deaths and destruction, putting millions at risk of serious violations and generating grave humanitarian needs. Thousands of people have been killed, injured, or maimed, including hundreds of children. Throughout 2023, fighting and hostilities continued to ravage parts of Ukraine and cause massive damage to civilian infrastructure - homes, schools, hospitals, and water, gas and power systems are repeatedly hit and, in some cases, directly targeted. This compounded the widespread destruction that had already decimated essential services across the country, particularly in the east, where people have now endured 10 years of war, caused by Russia’s invasion. The war has forced millions to flee and nearly 4 million people – including nearly 1 million children – are still internally displaced across Ukraine, while over 6 million live as refugees abroad. Prolonged displacement has pushed many to the brink, as they depleted their resources and capacity to cope with loss of job or income Over 14.6 million people – about 40 per cent of the Ukrainian population – will need humanitarian assistance in 2024. The UN-led response aims to reach about 8.5 million people with assistance. Although the impact of the war remains far-reaching, needs are more acute in the east and the south, close to the front-line. In these areas, including territories under Russian occupation, over 3.3 million people need aid, and the humanitarian situation is reaching levels of extreme and catastrophic severity. Millions of civilians there struggle every day to have adequate access to water, food, health, housing, protection and other essential services and supplies. At the same time, assistance to people living in Russian-occupied areas is extremely limited, and in some cases, impossible. Increased support to these people, who desperately need aid, will depend on improved access for humanitarian organizations. The humanitarian community has worked intensively to carry out life-saving activities in Ukraine in 2023, building upon the major scale up on the response that followed the escalation of the war in 2022. Nearly 11 million people received life-saving and life-sustaining assistance from over 500 humanitarian organizations. Aid organizations made efforts to reach the most vulnerable who are exposed to hostilities on a dai

Content:
Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. Since the 1970s the study of international relations has been marked by a renewed debate about the relationship between structures and institutions in international systems. On one side of the controversy was a revival of the school of realism, known as neorealism, which emerged with the publication of Kenneth Waltz’s Theory of International Politics in 1979. Neorealism represented an effort to inject greater precision, or conceptual rigour, into realist theory. While retaining power as a central explanatory notion, Waltz’s neorealism also incorporated the idea of structure as it is reflected in alliances and other cooperative arrangements among states of varying sizes, strengths, and capabilities. A bipolar system, for example, is a structure in which two states are dominant and the remaining states are allied with one or the other dominant state. According to Waltz and other neorealists, the structure of the international system limits the foreign-policy options available to states and influences international institutions in important ways. The United Nations (UN), for example, mirrors the structure of the existing international system insofar as it is dominated by leading powers such as the permanent members of the Security Council. Changes in international structure, including the rise of new powers, eventually lead to changes within international institutions. Thus, some neorealists have suggested that the Security Council’s permanent membership will eventually be expanded to include countries such as Germany, India, Japan, and others. On the other side of the structures-institutions debate have been the neoliberal institutionalists, who contend that institutions matter beyond simply reflecting or codifying the power structure of the international system. Although neoliberal institutionalists accept the realist conception of states as the principal actors in a fundamentally anarchic environment, they argue that state behaviour can be modified by interaction with international institutions such as the European Union (EU), NATO, the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the UN. Such interaction, they contend, reduces the long-term potential for international conflict. Although neorealist structuralists and neoliberal institutionalists generally agree that internation

Research Focus: Humanitarian Crisis and Refugee Situation
Source: https://news.un.org/en/story/2024/11/1157331
Content:
The UN refugee agency (UNHCR) has launched a $10 billion appeal for 2025 to meet critical needs and implement sustainable solutions for millions of refugees, displaced persons and stateless people worldwide. Announced earlier this week, the agency’s Global Appeal comes amid escalating humanitarian crises, as conflict, persecution and the growing impacts of climate change continue to force millions from their homes. “We live in an era of relentless emergencies. Of crises without end,” High Commissioner Filippo Grandi said, emphasising the scale of the challenges in a foreword accompanying the appeal. He highlighted recent and ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon, which have driven massive displacement, while also noting the protracted nature of many refugee situations, including those involving displaced populations from Myanmar and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Fully funded, the appeal aims to support more than 139 million refugees and other vulnerable groups in some 136 countries and territories. The appeal focuses on three primary areas: emergency response, inclusion, and long-term solutions. UNHCR remains committed to its frontline role in emergencies, providing life-saving aid to displaced individuals, Mr. Grandi said, adding: “When conflict breaks out, UNHCR is among the first to respond.” The appeal also goes beyond immediate assistance, calling for sustainable approaches that integrate displaced individuals into local and national systems. UNHCR aims to work with governments, civil society and development actors to promote inclusion in education, healthcare, and employment. Of the 139.3 million targeted beneficiaries, 34 million (24 per cent) are refugees, 68 million (48 per cent) internally displaced, 12 million are returnees, and about 4.5 million are stateless people under the agency’s mandate. Around $2.1 is required for UNHCR programmes in Middle East and North Africa, $1.2 billion in Europe, $957 million in Asia and the Pacific, and $815 million in the Americas. Across the African continent, $2.1 billion is needed in East and Horn of Africa and the Great Lakes, $1.2 billion in West and Central Africa and $451 million in Southern Africa. UNHCR anticipates that the Asia-Pacific region in 2025 could face increased displacement due to conflict, persecution, climate change impacts and yet more disasters. It projects a rise in

Isaac Cantrell VIRIN: 200322-M-WB494-1023 Military organizations tend to think about their overarching strategy in two ways: how their organization will remain relevant and which future operations they must be able to conduct.1 In the information era, military organizations struggle with the “design capabilities that will offer . . . credible strategic options and then the ability to win, through fighting smarter.”2 Building on the revolution in military affairs programs, a new era of digital innovations in the commercial realm underpins the U.S. National Defense Strategy and Third Offset Strategy to explore the use of new technologies for the military.3 While new operational concepts such as hyper war and kill webs are emerging, attention to the strategic element of innovation seems difficult to realize regarding military logistics.4 Strategic innovation concerns processes of proactive and systematic thinking about gaps that an organization can fulfill by developing new game plans.5 In the U.S. military, the Third Offset Strategy has major and unexplored implications for logistics. New technologies have crossover effects for operations and logistics. For instance, drones are becoming part of new operations, and they can support logistics, such as picking up wounded soldiers or secretly resupplying special operations forces. New technologies, however, need new versatile support networks. They also incur cyber risks, particularly in an antiaccess/area-denial environment.6 Innovations powered by crossovers between operations and logistics cannot be addressed with present routines.

Michael Trimble and Jobie Turner The ability of the United States military to deploy, supply, and redeploy its forces is unparalleled in the history of warfare. Professor Colin S. Gray writes that the U.S. military may “not have always been well-directed strategically or operationally. But that military establishment has always shown a mastery of logistics.” Since the end of the Second World War, logistics has been the great asymmetric advantage of the U.S. military. However, current and emerging challenges demand an updated concept of military logistics. It will be difficult for the U.S. military to overcome the strategic complacency that has naturally resulted from decades of U.S. military logistical wins. As far back as the Civil War, legions of U.S. ground vehicles, ships, and later planes have always delivered in victory, and even in defeat. While military history in general abounds with logistical failures, the study of American military history reveals that superior U.S. logistics has repeatedly bailed out poor planning, sub-optimal operational decisions, and tactical errors. Even though American combatants have suffered under terrible conditions in such places as the Chosin Reservoir, the siege of Khe Sanh, and more recently in the fall of 2001 in the mountains of Afghanistan, they have never wanted for long. The last time an adversary was able to critically disrupt American supply lines was at Kasserine Pass in the fall of 1942. M3 Stuart Tank at the Battle of Kasserine Pass, 1943 (History.net) Today, however, this proud tradition is at risk. The COVID-19 pandemic exposed vulnerabilities in the logistics of the American economy and the U.S. military. Supply chains are too dependent on foreign nations, too lean, and brittle. Fast and efficient in good times, global supply chains became slow and chaotic in crisis. Millions of consumers looking for toilet paper, N95 masks, or other goods discovered these limitations in 2020. The light, lean, and lethal supply chain of the United States halted when shocks to supply, demand, and international shipping stressed the system (although the supply chain has proven resilient over a longer time horizon.) This disturbance in logistics has strategic implications for the ability of the U.S. military to move to war. Although the United States military possesses thousands of trucks, ships, and aircraft in addition to

Research Focus: Geopolitical Tensions and External Interference
Source: https://www.grandviewresearch.com/research-insights/geopolitical-factors-trade-risks-impact-supply-chain
Content:
In 2024, geopolitical risks are expected to significantly impact supply chains across the globe. Various factors, such as political instability, trade disputes, and regional conflicts, will lead to disruptions in the flow of goods and services. This may result in increased costs, longer lead times, and decreased overall efficiency for businesses. Firms operating in the sourcing and procurement sectors especially will be impacted negatively as conflicts further increase supply chain bottlenecks. During military standoffs between nations, the interdependence of supply chain networks is at risk of being compromised. As a result of political uncertainty, procurement strategies can abruptly change, in turn affecting the flow of goods. Geopolitical tensions undermine traditional trade channels, with far-reaching consequences for global supply chains and procurement executives. The smooth flow of goods and materials can be disrupted in strategic waterways and transit corridors during times of geopolitical tension. Trade routes may be shut down, delayed, or subjected to increased security procedures, disrupting the flow of goods between countries. Heightening geopolitical tensions may also lead to the introduction of tariffs and trade barriers between contending nations. Some of the major geopolitical risks in 2024 include the Israel – Hamas conflict, Houthi missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea, Russian-NATO tensions, climate risk, energy security, cyberattacks, U.S. – China tensions, and upcoming elections across major nations in 2024. The escalating tensions between major powers, such as the United States and China, are leading to potential trade wars or even military conflicts. The impacts of climate change could exacerbate resource scarcity and create new political and economic challenges, particularly in vulnerable areas. Energy and climate change continue to exist as politically sensitive and controversial topics with global progress on the climate transition which is particularly deficient. However, following the Russian-Ukraine war, the global energy price shock should prompt decarbonization efforts. After Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, there has been an increase in concern about trade resilience and national security. Procurement executives are increasingly pursuing reshoring, near-shoring, and friend-shoring programs globally. In the aftermath of

They are frameworks that help us understand how different social, political, and economic factors have shaped and influenced history. There are three main types of historical lenses: social, political, and economic. Here is a brief overview of each: By using these different historical lenses, we can gain a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the past and how social, political, and economic factors have shaped the world.

There are several historical lenses, including social, political, and economic lenses. Each of these lenses focuses on specific factors that have shaped history. For example, a historian might use a social lens to examine how class, race, and gender have shaped history. They might look at how different social groups have interacted with each other and society and how these interactions have impacted history. Similarly, a historian might use a political lens to examine how governments, laws, and power structures have shaped history. They might look at how different political systems and ideologies change history and how political actors have influenced the course of events. Finally, a historian might use an economic lens to examine how trade, industry, and wealth have shaped history. They might look at how different economic systems and policies change the world and how economic factors have influenced the actions and decisions of actors. A social lens looks at how social factors, such as class, race, gender, and ethnicity, have shaped and influenced events. This lens helps us understand how different groups of people have interacted with each other. Here are some examples of how events and developments can be examined through a social lens: A social lens can help us to understand how different social factors, such as class, race, and gender, have influenced events and developments in history. Historians can analyze the past through a political lens by examining how different political factors, such as governments, laws, and power structures, have shaped and influenced events and developments. To do this, historians might look at a variety of sources, such as political documents, laws, and speeches,

Content:
political economy, branch of social science that studies the relationships between individuals and society and between markets and the state, using a diverse set of tools and methods drawn largely from economics, political science, and sociology. The term political economy is derived from the Greek polis, meaning “city” or “state,” and oikonomos, meaning “one who manages a household or estate.” Political economy thus can be understood as the study of how a country—the public’s household—is managed or governed, taking into account both political and economic factors.

It is the chief instrument of foreign policy. Its methods include secret negotiation by accredited envoys (though political leaders also negotiate) and international agreements and laws. Its use predates recorded history. The goal of diplomacy is to further the state’s interests as dictated by geography, history, and economics. Safeguarding the state’s independence, security, and integrity is of prime importance; preserving the widest possible freedom of action for the state is nearly as important. Beyond that, diplomacy seeks maximum national advantage without using force and preferably without causing resentment.

Research Focus: Humanitarian Crisis and Refugee Situation
Source: https://press.un.org/en/2024/sc15713.doc.htm
Content:
Stressing the grave and unprecedented challenges to peace and security, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees told the Security Council in a briefing today that 2024 is even worse than last year in terms of the number of refugees and internally displaced people worldwide. Filippo Grandi, the High Commissioner for Refugees, reported that last year, 114 million people were displaced by war, violence and persecution. “Next month we will update this figure. It will be higher,” he said, adding that humanitarians are near a breaking point and that respect for the basic rules of war is almost non-existent. Among the many haunting images from the conflict in Gaza is that of desperate people trapped and often killed inside a war zone. “Their safety should be our — your — paramount concern,” he said, adding that under international law, an occupying Power must not force a civilian population to flee the territory it occupies. Turning to Syria, he highlighted the presence of 5.6 million Syrian refugees and proposals by some European countries to send them back to so-called “safe areas” in the country. The refugees’ voluntary, safe return home is the best solution, and the Government must alleviate the fear many have of being targeted or concern over abysmal living conditions in the country. At the same time, donors must increase support to early recovery activities as per Security Council resolution 2642 (2022). “If we are serious about solving the Syrian refugee problem — and we must be — the only way forward is to overcome political constraints and work on both tracks, with all stakeholders,” he said. In Myanmar, over 3 million people have been displaced by fighting, and humanitarians operate in a high-risk environment. And in the Democratic Republic of Congo, no other place on Earth is as dangerous for women and children as the east of that country. In Ukraine, international humanitarian law gets violated every day and displacement continues to increase. And in Sudan, 9 million people are displaced inside the country or refugees in neighbouring countries. Yet despite the need, the international community continues to neglect the situation with aid activities inside that country funded at only 15 per cent and the refugee operations at 8 per cent. Short-sighted foreign policy decisions, often founded on double standards, pay lip service to compliance with

Research Focus: Political and Diplomatic Context
Source: https://fhsu.pressbooks.pub/orientationpolisci/chapter/chapter-7-international-relations-and-comparative-politics/
Content:
It is a large and comprehensive area of study that in some academic contexts is a separate discipline from political science. As a separate discipline, international relations (or what is sometimes called international studies, international affairs, area studies, global affairs, or global studies) is a rich interdisciplinary field of study that draws direct connections to other disciplines such as geography, psychology, demography, history, economics, and feminism, among others. In academia outside the UK and the US, the study of political science is often exclusively the study of international relations. In American academia especially, international relations is typically considered a sub-discipline of the broader field of political science, and for our purposes here, we will view international relations in this context. The academic study of international relations has been traditionally dominated by positivist inquiry—it seeks a descriptive and objective understanding of our global world and the forces and relations that shape the international context. Positive statements, in this sense, are contrasted with normative statements: the former are statements that describe what is, whereas the latter are statements that directions for what ought to be (see the normative basis of political theory in Chapter Six for more discussion on this matter). But from a public policy perspective, international relations is normative in its inquiry, directing policy shapers toward actions that can better the world. Broadly speaking, public policy are a set of directions for how executive bureaucracy acts in the execution of law, and so defines what “should be” in terms of state action, not what is. Take, for example, the issue of nuclear weapons. An academic and positivist approach may objectively determine the number of nuclear weapons in the world and which countries possess them. From a policy perspective, however, international relations provides a field from which a number of policy proposals are presented—how nuclear weapons proliferation should be curtailed, how to keep certain rogue actors from obtaining nuclear weapons, or how to limit the threat of nuclear weapons in the international environment. International relations theory (theories that govern relations in an international environment) have traditionally been positive (realist, liberal, and regime theory

Prepared by Maria Grazia Attinasi, Mirco Balatti, Michele Mancini and Luca Metelli Published as part of the ECB Economic Bulletin, Issue 8/2021. Strains in global production networks, which started to emerge in late 2020, are a reflection of imbalances between the supply and demand of certain goods and are creating headwinds for the ongoing global economic recovery. Strains in global production networks, also commonly referred to as supply bottlenecks, are a multifaceted phenomenon. The decline and subsequent recovery in economic activity during the COVID-19 pandemic have been unprecedented, reflecting the massive shifts in demand and supply triggered by the closing and reopening of economies, and amid considerable monetary and fiscal stimulus and high levels of accumulated savings, especially in advanced economies. Moreover, as pandemic-related containment measures severely restricted consumption opportunities in the services sector (in particular travel, tourism and recreational activities), there was a rotation in demand towards merchandise goods, which compounded the already strong cyclical recovery in the goods sector. Faced with that strong surge in demand, suppliers of goods worldwide have been struggling to meet the increase in orders. In addition, idiosyncratic supply chain disruptions (owing to the waves of the pandemic and adverse weather events, for instance) have also played a role, capping activity and trade growth and ultimately pushing up prices. This box reviews the main features of the ongoing supply bottlenecks. First, it aims to disentangle supply chain disruptions from demand-side factors, claiming that while the latter are a manifestation of the current phase of the business cycle, the former may indeed curb the pace of the recovery and therefore warrant close monitoring. Second, it provides an empirical assessment of the impact of supply chain disruptions on global economic activity and prices, and the assumptions about how they will evolve going forward.[1] Supply chain disruptions are putting a drag on activity and trade at the global level. The most relevant elements are i) difficulties in the logistics and transportation sector, ii) semiconductor shortages, iii) pandemic-related restrictions on economic activity, and iv) labour shortages. Global shipping of merchandise goods has been severely disrupted owing to container misplaceme

Content:
In September, President Biden announced a surge in security assistance and additional actions to help Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia’s aggression. And today, the United States is imposing significant new sanctions on over 50 financial institutions to further degrade Russia’s ability to use the international financial system to fund and prosecute its brutal war against the people of Ukraine. These targets include Gazprombank, Russia’s largest remaining bank not sanctioned by the United States, as well as 50 other persons and entities operating in the Russian financial sector. In response to Russian aggression, President Biden has led international efforts alongside the G7 and many of our allies and partners to hold Russia accountable for its aggression. Today’s sanctions will further curtail Russia’s abuse of the international financial system to help finance its war against Ukraine. The United States remains committed to putting Ukraine in the strongest possible position, and we will continue to take all available steps to do so from surging security assistance to imposing and fully enforcing sanctions and other restrictions on Russia’s war machine. ### We'll be in touch with the latest information on how President Biden and his administration are working for the American people, as well as ways you can get involved and help our country build back better.

In October 2024, representatives from the United Kingdom’s (UK) Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) and the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) convened in Washington, DC at our annual technical exchange, marking the second anniversary of our Enhanced Partnership. In response to increasingly complex geopolitical developments, sanctions continue to be a critical tool in tackling threats to the United States’ and United Kingdom’s national security. Together, we are steadfast in continuing to limit the ability of Russia to finance and support its illegal and unprovoked invasion of Ukraine, while responding to the conflicts in the Middle East. As we stated in 2022, financial sanctions work best when implemented multilaterally, and we remain committed to designing, communicating, and implementing new sanctions in close coordination with each other, as well as with other key allies and partners. It is imperative that we collaborate with each other and industry to ensure sanctions are implemented as effectively as possible. This year marked a significant milestone in our enduring relationship as we moved from establishing a shared understanding to developing critical solutions to common problems via ongoing communication throughout the year. Whilst our annual technical exchange is an important feature of our relationship, it is the regular engagement between colleagues across all levels of our organizations that truly embodies the enhanced partnership. One of the most enriching aspects of the partnership, including these exchanges, is the opportunity to conduct joint private sector outreach. As part of the exchange, we met with the Bank Policy Institute to discuss critical issues facing financial institutions, differences in UK and U.S. sanctions regimes, and possibilities for future alignment. The private sector is a critical partner in helping uphold our shared national security goals, and we welcome opportunities to not only promote compliance and understanding, but also hear about shared challenges when navigating our sanctions regimes. Both OFAC and OFSI have made significant progress this year on new initiatives to support sanctions implementation by the private sector. OFAC has begun updating its “baseline” FAQs on general sanctions questions and issues, issued key humanitarian guidance in Arabic, and pub

Research Focus: Military Conflict Dynamics

Content:
The introduction and analysis of a simple idealized model enables basic insights into how military characteristics and recruitment strategies affect the dynamics of armed conflicts, even in the complex case of three or more fighting groups. In particular, the model shows when never ending wars (stalemates) are possible and how initial conditions and interventions influence a conflict’s fate. The analysis points out that defensive recruitment policies aimed at compensating for suffered losses lead to conflicts with simple dynamics, while attack groups sensitive to the damages they inflict onto their enemies can give rise to conflicts with turbulent behaviours. Since non-governmental groups often follow attack strategies, the conclusion is that the evolution of conflicts involving groups of that kind can be expected to be difficult to forecast.

Data Availability: All relevant data are within the manuscript. Funding: The authors received no specific funding for this work. Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist. The interest in mathematical models of armed conflicts has increased in the last decades [1–4] owing to the wide prevalence and complex nature of such conflicts. Armed conflicts often involve more than two groups, which typically differ in their military characteristics and recruitment policies [5]. Thus, traditional descriptive conceptual models, like those suggested long ago by Lanchester [6] and Richardson [7–9] (for a review, see [10]), are of limited help. The idealized model we propose indicates that stalemates, i.e., conflicts with no winner, arise. Stalemates can be stationary or have recurrent ups and downs in the army sizes and in the inflicted and suffered losses. Second, the model shows how outcomes depend on initial cond

Frayed health care and an overwhelmed global humanitarian system imperil the health of civilians. Note: This situation is fluid. Please check with credible news outlets such as the Associated Press for the most up-to-date information. This article was last updated on October 20, 2023. As conflict rages with the Israel-Hamas war, the growing crisis is straining an already overwhelmed global humanitarian system. In this Q&A, humanitarian health expert Paul Spiegel, MD, MPH ’96, discusses the immediate health concerns of civilians in the Gaza strip, the humanitarian response, and opportunities to stay informed and to advocate for humanitarian principles and international humanitarian law. Spiegel is a Distinguished Professor of the Practice in the Department of International Health. He is also the director of the Center for Humanitarian Health at the Bloomberg School. Can you provide some background on the humanitarian health crisis in Gaza leading up to now? The health system in Gaza prior to this current crisis faced numerous challenges rooted in a complex geopolitical situation. The Israeli blockade of Gaza since 2007, when Hamas rose to power, combined with the intermittent conflicts that have occurred, has left the health infrastructure and services fractured, of varying quality, and with a limited number of specialized health services and technology. The blockade has complicated the importation of essential medical supplies and equipment, and there are frequent shortages. Health care workers in Gaza have been incredibly resilient and dedicated despite these challenges. However, there remain human resource gaps, particularly in specialty areas like oncology, where Palestinians need to go outside of Gaza to receive some treatments. The socioeconomic, political, and environmental factors in Gaza combined with these challenges to the health system culminate in a fragile health status of many Palestinians in Gaza. While there have been some improvements over the past decade, life expectancy is lower and infant and maternal mortality rates are higher compared to other areas in the region. There is a high prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, particularly diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. Mental health issues among children and adults are particularly high, driven by numerous factors including recurrent hostilities. Rates of acute and chroni

Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, entering its third year, has exacted a “horrific human cost”, inflicting immense suffering on millions of civilians that will be felt “for generations”, UN human rights chief Volker Türk said on Thursday. “Russia’s full-scale armed attack on Ukraine, which is about to enter its third year with no end in sight, continues to cause serious and widespread human rights violations, destroying lives and livelihoods,” he said in a statement launching a new report. This month marks not only two years since Moscow’s all out assault, but also 10 years since Russia illegally annexed Ukraine’s Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of Sevastopol. In its latest report, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine has verified 30,457 civilian casualties since 24 February 2022, including 10,582 killed and 19,875 injured, with the actual numbers likely to be significantly higher. Millions have been displaced, thousands have lost their homes, and hundreds of medical and educational institutions have been damaged or destroyed, significantly impacting people’s rights to health and education. “The long-term impact of this war in Ukraine will be felt for generations,” Mr. Türk said. Over the past two years, human rights office OHCHR has documented widespread torture, ill-treatment and arbitrary detention of civilians by Russian armed forces. Summary executions, enforced disappearances and repression of the right to freedom of expression and assembly have also been documented in occupied territory. In addition, interviews with over 550 former Ukrainian prisoners of war and civilian detainees by the monitoring mission have indicated the commission of serious violations of international human rights law and international humanitarian law by Russian armed forces, including summary execution and widespread torture. Since 24 February 2022, the already dire human rights situation in occupied Crimea has worsened, with a crackdown on those criticizing the occupation. The UN Human Rights Office will release a report on the decade-long Russian occupation next week. “The ongoing Russian assault does not exempt Ukrainian forces from their own obligations to respect international human rights law and international humanitarian law,” the UN rights chief said. During the past two years, the Office has documented a number of violations committed b

Content:
After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, the conflict in the Middle East continues to dominate the world's attention. But it's impossible to understand the headlines without knowing the history. The “Holy Land”—a moniker that Israelis and Palestinians share for their beloved region—has been mired in conflict for more than a century. When the long-decaying Ottoman Empire collapsed after World War I, both Jews and Palestinian Arabs expected a state where they could finally be in charge of their own fate. But why was a piece of land the size of Massachusetts promised to two peoples? Explore the history behind the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, its key moments and figures, and the prospects and obstacles for peace. The prospects for peace have been shaped by devastating wars. The 1948 Arab-Israeli War—an existential one that the Israelis call the War of Independence and the Palestinians call the Nakba (“Catastrophe”)—created the borders we know today as Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. The Six-Day War (1967) later brought the West Bank and the Gaza Strip under Israeli military occupation. Tired of bloodshed after fighting in the Lebanese Civil War and the first intifada in the 1980s, Israelis and Palestinians formally recognized one another in the Oslo I Accord in 1993 and set out a pathway to lasting peace. Still, in the 21st century peace remains elusive. Why didn’t the Oslo peace process work? One reason is that the Oslo Accords left open some of the most pressing issues, including the fate of the mixed Jewish-Arab city of Jerusalem, the fate of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the status of millions of stateless refugees, and the borders of a viable Palestinian Authority. In recent years the conflict has become particularly hot over the Temple Mount and the fate of Palestinian neighborhoods such as Sheikh Jarrah.

Professor Eugene Rogan is a renowned scholar in Modern Middle Eastern History, serving as the Director of the Middle East Centre and a Fellow of St Antony's College at the University of Oxford. He authored The Arabs: A History—acclaimed by The Economist, The Financial Times, and The Atlantic Monthly as one of the best books of 2009—and his latest work, The Fall of the Ottomans: The Great War in the Middle East, 1914-1920, continues to contribute significantly to the field. You have written extensively about the Ottoman Empire in The Fall of the Ottomans and Frontiers of the State in Late Ottoman Empire as well as more generally about Arab history in The Arabs. Where do you see the Israeli-Palestinian conflict fitting into this narrative? Since 1948, and indeed well before, the conflict between the Zionist movement in Palestine and the emerging state of Israel was to define the Middle East as a zone of conflict. What was an Arab-Israeli conflict through the 1970s has, since the Camp David Accords, developed into a much more focused conflict between Israel and Palestine. There have been exceptions: Israel has fought wars in southern Lebanon against Hezbollah and has had small engagements with Syria. However, if you want to get to the heart of the unresolved, it really is Israel-Palestine. We can talk about a conflict that has endured unresolved since 1948 and continues to define the politics of the region and its place in the world. You mention 1948—what do you see as the starting point of the Israel-Palestine conflict, and how have early events like the creation of modern Zionism, the Balfour Declaration, or the establishment of the state of Israel in 1948 shaped its course? Israel did not emerge from a vacuum in 1948. The 1917 Balfour Declaration is a really important point. Before 1917, Zionism was a very unrealistic nationalism, because the demography of the movement was in diaspora. Nationalism [is usually] based on the idea that the demography [is based] on a geography, [a] struggle for self-determination within the boundaries of a certain territory of land. Zionism was an appeal to Jews across four continents, and it took the support of a major power to take that idea from romantic and idealistic to something you could hope to act on. By gaining the direct support of the British government—not for the Zionist movement, not for the creation of a Jewish s

Sandor Fabian | 05.14.21 The 2018 US National Defense Strategy (NDS) signals a major shift for the US military from irregular warfare toward developing capabilities for conventional wars against near-peer and peer competitors. Recent events such as the Russian military buildup along the Ukrainian border and the provocative Chinese naval and air activities near Taiwan seem to support such realignment of US military capabilities. At the same time, the 2020 Irregular Warfare Annex to the 2018 NDS suggests that irregular warfare capabilities must remain core competencies of the military because the US conventional overmatch will encourage both state and nonstate adversaries to seek indirect approaches to challenge the United States and its allies. Conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan, and Ukraine are examples of how both state and nonstate adversaries have used irregular warfare to advance their strategic goals. Many argue that this debate is the most important US defense policy question of our day because the answer will determine the direction of long-term military capability development for the United States and its partners. However, the current debate is not an optimal way to inform long-term military capability development because its foundations are faulty. The current understanding of irregular and conventional warfare envisions them as two distinct, mutually exclusive categories. Policy documents, military doctrine, and academia all support such strong differentiation. However, this conceptualization is fundamentally flawed because it suggests that the two categories have their own distinct warfighting methods necessitating two separate sets of military capabilities. A different theoretical approach to the debate could remedy this problem, allowing US policymakers to better prepare military capabilities for future conflicts. Instead of understanding irregular and conventional warfare as separate categories of conflict, scholars and practitioners should consider their differences as running along a linear continuum. The False Dichotomy US academics, policymakers, and military practitioners seem to take three sides when it comes to the irregular-versus-conventional warfare debate, all of which are based on the same flawed assumption. First, some believe that the United States should remain focused on irregular warfare. They argue that such

The current conflict between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces, who are battling for control of the country, has exacerbated the nation’s existing humanitarian crisis, leaving 24.8 million people—more than half of the nation’s population—in need of humanitarian aid. Additionally, reports of ethnic cleansing in Darfur have raised alarm among multilateral organizations about the risk of genocide and a repeat of the tragic circumstances seen in the region 20 years ago.

It is one of more than 100,000 firsthand testimonies collected by MCV. On February 24, 2022 Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine with Russian forces committing widespread attacks against civilians. On February 18, 2023, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken determined that members of Russia’s forces and other Russian officials had committed crimes against humanity in Ukraine. Two years after the military invasion, we spoke with the MCV about their efforts to preserve and share the personal stories of individuals affected by the war. The Museum of Civilian Voices (MCV) is the world’s largest collection of stories from civilians who have suffered from Russia’s war against Ukraine. The MCV can trace its inception back to 2014, when the Rinat Akhmetov Foundation deployed its Here to Help Humanitarian Center to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe in the Donbas. Thanks to its activities, the Center helped save three and a half million people—many of whom shared their stories with the Foundation. As a result, the Foundation was able to gather thousands of stories from Donbas civilians and compile them into a unique online museum. The mission of the MCV is to collect, file, categorize, and share the stories of Ukraine’s civilians for a better understanding of life amid the war and to lay the foundation for a better future. All the stories posted in the MCV were told by their authors in the first person and reflect their own personal lived experiences. These Ukrainians’ stories were collected and then published with their permission. The MCV also aims to become a unique psychotherapeutic project that will contribute to the psychological well-being and mental health of Ukrainians traumatized by the war by giving them the opportunity to share their stories. The MCV aims to be the primary source of truth; it records testimonies during the war and publishes them on an online portal, where they are then accessible for use and sharing by any and all who are interested in preserving historical memory. Each of these first-hand narratives are guided by the presumption of trust and honesty in people who choose to share their stories. At

Content:
Statement by Ambassador James Kariuki at the Security Council open debate on general issues relating to sanctions Thank you Mr President, and let me start by wishing you the best for your Presidency this month. I thank USG DiCarlo and USG Griffiths for their briefing. The UN Security Council has a unique responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is right that we make full and judicious use of every tool at our disposal in the pursuit of this goal. Targeted sanctions are one such tool — set out in the Charter, as our briefers said today, they can play an important role as part of a comprehensive approach alongside diplomacy, peacebuilding and peacekeeping. The value of sanctions has been proven. In Angola, Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, and Sierra Leone they helped end conflict and support the transition to peace and democracy, following which sanctions were duly lifted. In the Central African Republic, they have improved the practices of a mining company. In Somalia, the arms embargo has enabled the seizure of thousands of ammunition rounds, anti-tank guided missiles and sniper rifles reportedly intended for Al-Shabaab. Today, sanctions are an important means of countering the threat of transnational terrorism and preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The Council is deploying them to constrain the activities of some of the world’s worst terrorists under the 1267 sanctions regime. We call on all parties to implement fully the sanctions this Council has agreed. Any use of sanctions has to take account of humanitarian factors. The UK was one of the top 5 humanitarian donors globally in 2021. We champion International Humanitarian Law and humanitarian access in conflict and crisis situations. The United Kingdom is committed to minimising any unintended consequences of sanctions, including on the delivery of humanitarian assistance. To achieve this, we advocate for carefully targeted sanctions, aimed at specific goals, as part of a comprehensive approach to conflict resolution. We support a range of humanitarian exceptions and licensing grounds in the application of sanctions. For example, and it was mentioned by Under-Secretary Griffiths today, we welcomed the unanimous support for the recent adoption of the UN Afghanistan humanitarian exemption, which was a good example of how sanctions regimes can be tailored to

Content:
Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. The global expansion of western Europe between the 1760s and the 1870s differed in several important ways from the expansionism and colonialism of previous centuries. Along with the rise of the Industrial Revolution, which economic historians generally trace to the 1760s, and the continuing spread of industrialization in the empire-building countries came a shift in the strategy of trade with the colonial world. Instead of being primarily buyers of colonial products (and frequently under strain to offer sufficient salable goods to balance the exchange), as in the past, the industrializing nations increasingly became sellers in search of markets for the growing volume of their machine-produced goods. Furthermore, over the years there occurred a decided shift in the composition of demand for goods produced in the colonial areas. Spices, sugar, and slaves became relatively less important with the advance of industrialization, concomitant with a rising demand for raw materials for industry (e.g., cotton, wool, vegetable oils, jute, dyestuffs) and food for the swelling industrial areas (wheat, tea, coffee, cocoa, meat, butter). This shift in trading patterns entailed in the long run changes in colonial policy and practice as well as in the nature of colonial acquisitions. The urgency to create markets and the incessant pressure for new materials and food were eventually reflected in colonial practices, which sought to adapt the colonial areas to the new priorities of the industrializing nations. Such adaptation involved major disruptions of existing social systems over wide areas of the globe. Before the impact of the Industrial Revolution, European activities in the rest of the world were largely confined to: (1) occupying areas that supplied precious metals, slaves, and tropical products then in large demand; (2) establishing white-settler colonies along the coast of North America; and (3) setting up trading posts and forts and applying superior military strength to achieve the transfer to European merchants of as much existing world trade as was feasible. However disruptive these changes may have been to the societies of Africa, South America, and the isolated plantation and white-settler colonies, the social systems over most of the Earth outside Europe nevertheless rem

Content:
By the end of this section, you will be able to: Like a chain of falling dominoes, industrial development in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries had many consequences, short and long term. To generate profits for themselves and their investors, businesses needed to operate inexpensively and sell as many goods as possible. To keep costs and therefore prices low, they sought inexpensive raw materials. They also wanted markets in which to sell their finished goods, preferably without competing with others. The ships that transported raw materials and finished products required ports where they could refuel and resupply, as did the navies that kept them safe. To the industrial powers, these needs justified their practice of imperialism, that is, the policy of gaining direct or indirect control over parts of the world with low-cost resources and no competing mass-produced goods. Improved forms of transportation, communication, weaponry, and medicine made this control possible. As the industrialized nations came to dominate states in Africa, Asia, and the Pacific, taking natural resources and money from them, they sent not only soldiers and administrators but also missionaries to introduce the inhabitants to Christianity and other aspects of western culture, often against their will. By the beginning of the Second Industrial Revolution, new inventions and industrial processes demanded new raw materials, such as petroleum to fuel engines, natural rubber for valves and tires, palm oil for lubricating machinery, copper to conduct heat and electricity, silver for medicine and photography, and lead for pipes. Coal was in demand to transform iron into steel, to produce the gas that heated homes, and to generate the electricity that powered machines and lit streets and buildings. Not all the industrialized nations could produce enough to supply their increased needs. New fashions and tastes also created demand for foreign imports. Middle-class families in Europe and the United States wanted their daughters to play the piano and drove a market in ivory (from which piano keys were once made). The need for quick sources of energy for industrial workers fueled an increased demand for coffee, tea, and sugar. Elites and aspiring members of the middle class filled their homes with furniture of mahogany, rosewood, and ebony. Cotton textiles remained fashionable, bu

Research Focus: The significance of the Donbass region as a strategic location
Source: https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60938544
Content:
Russian forces are bombarding towns and cities in eastern Ukraine with the declared aim of "liberating" the old industrial heartland known as Donbas. Having abandoned his campaign to capture the capital Kyiv and second city Kharkiv, Vladimir Putin is now looking for military victory in the largely Russian-speaking east, where he falsely accuses Ukraine of committing genocide. Achieving his goals in the east is the minimum he needs before he could end the operation and claim it a success. Russian forces already control large swathes of the south. Ukraine says the battle for Donbas is the biggest on European soil since World War Two but its president has vowed the military "will fight for every centimetre of our land". When Russia's leader talks about Donbas, he is not just referring to Ukraine's coal and steel-producing area. He is highlighting two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk, which run from outside Mariupol in the south all the way to the northern border with Russia. Donbas is predominantly Russian-speaking and after Russia seized Crimea in 2014, its proxy forces captured more than a third of Ukraine's east in a war that never came to an end. The Russian proxies created so-called people's republics that nobody recognised and Russia now plans to capture the rest of the east. Luhansk and Donetsk may be broadly Russian-speaking, but they are no longer pro-Russian. One Ukrainian opinion poll in May 2022 suggested 82% of Ukrainians in territory seized by Russia since the 24 February invasion had a negative attitude to Moscow. A month into the invasion, Russia scaled back its ambitions to capture the capital, Kyiv, and instead moved its focus to Donbas. By late March it claimed to have controlled 93% of Luhansk and 54% of Donetsk, although that was certainly an overstatement. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky declared in April that Russian forces had begun the battle for Donbas and that Ukrainian forces had long prepared for it. Russia is far from subduing the entire area, although if it captures the two big twin cities of Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, then all of Luhansk would be under its control.

Download PDF We should pay closer attention to the interactions between politics, economics, and other realms The COVID-19 pandemic strikingly illustrates the intersection of politics, economics, and other considerations. Public health experts have long warned that the world was likely to face a major pandemic and called for greater preparedness. Yet policymakers who have to focus on the next election find it difficult to invest the time, money, and political capital to address the abstract possibility of a future crisis. And so most of the world was unprepared for a global public health threat of the magnitude posed by the novel coronavirus. As the pandemic has raced across the world, the policy response has continued to be tempered by political realities. Some members of the public, and some policymakers, have resisted the recommendations of public health experts, hoping for relaxed restrictions and a return to normalcy before the dangers have passed. At the same time, business interests have pressed for exceptions to benefit themselves, and for substantial subsidies—bailouts—to help them through difficult times. At the international level, government responses to the pandemic illustrate the difficult politics of worldwide cooperation. A global pandemic requires a global response: microbes do not respect borders. A coordinated international response is clearly the best way to confront an international public health emergency. Yet policymakers under pressure from their constituents have diverted resources away from other countries, banned the export of food and drugs, and hoarded essential supplies. Each of these measures—popular as they may be to national publics—imposes costs on other countries. In the final analysis, the lack of cooperation makes everyone worse off. Such international institutions as the World Health Organization attempt to coordinate a cooperative global response to the global crisis—but they can be powerless in the face of potent nationalist political pressures (see, for example, Goodman and others 2010). Every government faces tough decisions about the appropriate measures: what restrictions to impose and when to loosen them, where money will be spent and how it will be raised, and what national concerns can be limited to favor international cooperation. These decisions have to take into account public health recommendations, economic

In a rapidly changing world, the United States must defend its interests and values against new threats and new competitors, especially from China and Russia. But it can't do it alone. Instead, the U.S. must strengthen relationships with existing partners and allies while also building new partnerships. Strengthening alliances and attracting new partners is one of three lines of effort central to the National Defense Strategy laid out in 2018. It's something Defense Secretary Dr. Mark T. Esper has been focused on since he took office last year. The secretary said developing a coordinated strategy for American allies and partners is among his top priorities.

Over the past year, with encouragement from the United States, NATO has enhanced its readiness by continuing to secure pledges from alliance members to increase their defense spending. About two-thirds of NATO nations have pledged to increase defense spending to 2% of their gross domestic product by 2021, but all have increased spending to some degree already. In the Indo-Pacific region, the department has strengthened alliances and partnerships by deepening interoperability, expanding deterrent networks, and executing maritime security and awareness operations. Also in the Indo-Pacific, the U.S. conducted a record number of freedom-of-navigation operations in the South China Sea over the past year, more than any other year since 2015, to deter China's malign behavior. For example, in July 2019, the USS Nimitz conducted exercises with the Indian navy in the Indian Ocean.

Content:
A staggering 100 million people have now been forced to flee their homes globally, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR, said on Thursday, highlighting worldwide food insecurity, the climate crisis, war in Ukraine and other emergencies from Africa to Afghanistan as leading causes. “Every year of the last decade, the numbers have climbed,” said UNHCR chief Filippo Grandi. “Either the international community comes together to take action to address this human tragedy, resolve conflicts and find lasting solutions, or this terrible trend will continue.” Today, one in every 78 people on earth is displaced; it’s a “dramatic milestone” that few would have expected a decade ago, UNHCR said. By the end of 2021, the number displaced by war, violence, persecution and human rights abuses stood at 89.3 million, according to the agency’s annual Global Trends report. That was up eight per cent from 2020 and “well over double the figure of 10 years ago”, the report’s authors said, attributing last year’s increase to numerous escalating conflicts “and new ones that flared”. The 100 million displaced figure was reached in May, 10 weeks since the Russian invasion of Ukraine prompted a global cereal and fertilizer shortage from these major exporters that UN humanitarians have reacted to with increasing alarm. Asked at a press conference in Geneva whether the global food insecurity crisis now underway was likely to push yet more people to leave their homes, High Commissioner Grandi said he “could not imagine how” it could be otherwise. “If you have a food crisis on top of…war, human rights (violations), climate, you name it; on top of that if you have a food crisis, it will just accelerate the trends are described in this report and that we have seen accelerate in already in the first few months of the year.” This meant that what countries were doing to withstand the spiralling cereal and fuel prices was of paramount importance also to prevent a larger number of people moving, the UNHCR chief continued, “which if you ask me how many, I don’t know, but it could be pretty big numbers”. In all, 23 countries with a combined population of 850 million faced “medium or high-intensity conflicts”, the UN agency said, citing World Bank data. Among the 89.3 million globally displaced last year, 27.1 million were refugees – 21.3 million under UNHCR’s mandate, and 5.8 million Palestinians under the

Primary questions include the compatibility and legitimacy of sanctions regimes, enforcement measures, including the role of sanctions committees, the practice of circumventing sanctions, and the relation with the ICC proceedings. Legal and institutional aspects of the practice of the European Union are addressed. The extraterritorial effects of national legislation implementing sanctions imposed by individual States are investigated. A focus is on the impact of sanctions on non-State actors. The connections with the protection of human rights and the adverse impact on individual rights are considered. The implementation of sanctions is addressed in view of their legal limitation and the concept of proportionality, their consequences upon existing treaties and contracts, their effectiveness, and their strategic implications.

Research Focus: The impact of economic factors, including sanctions and trade disruptions, on the war

Content:
Russiaâs war in Ukraine is an ongoing tragedy, destroying lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and altering economic patterns worldwide. In May 2022, we set out an initial analysis of 12 disruptions that the war could unleash. With the passage of time, it seems increasingly likely that the war, coming so soon after a global pandemic, could presage a new economic era. We have been here before: todayâs shocks are reminiscent of the immediate aftermath of World War II (1944â46), the oil crisis (1971â73), and the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989â92). Each of those events changed the global landscape with the sudden release of powerful underlying forces that had been building up around a fault line over time. Each ushered in a new era. To understand the shape of the era now unfolding, we have tracked the evolution of the warâs disruptions since May 2022. At that time, some disruptions were already well under wayânotably the humanitarian crisis that followed immediately from the invasion. As we highlighted, others were less predictable but worth watchingâfor example, we noted that the direct impact of the war on financial systems had so far been limited, but that risks from wider ripple effects might materialize. In this update, we look at whatâs happened in the 16 months since the invasion. As recent events in Ukraine highlight, the ultimate outcome remains profoundly uncertain. However, we find five disruptions with clear effects that may endure: the humanitarian crisis, energy source diversification, defense spending increases, cyber as a stage for conflict, and corporationsâ pull-back from Russia. Three other disruptions have eased, as connections in our global system, together with cooling of demand, buffered their effects. These include spikes in prices and supply disruptions for food, metals, and minerals, which have now dissipated. Of course, in the past year, forces beyond the war in Ukraine have also roiled the system in compounding, intertwined ways: the steady rise of interest rates, Chinaâs lockdown and reopening, severe weather, and broader geopolitical tensions. All are contributing additional uncertainty. These forces have become the most important drivers of three more disruptions we noted in May 2022âmost prominently, the burden carried by the poorest people, a splintering of tech standards, and financial-system instability.

The Middle East Program in Washington combines in-depth regional knowledge with incisive comparative analysis to provide deeply informed recommendations. With expertise in the Gulf, North Africa, Iran, and Israel/Palestine, we examine crosscutting themes of political, economic, and social change in both English and Arabic. Russia’s role in the Levant and its involvement in the region’s power politics have undergone a significant shift over the past decade, mainly because of opportunities created by geopolitical and regional developments, including, most critically, the pivoting of U.S. foreign policy away from the Middle East and forever wars. These developments opened the door in 2015 to a more active Russian role in reshaping a region that was in the throes of societal upheavals and expanding conflicts. The United States’ growing disengagement became especially evident following the failure of U.S. former president Barack Obama’s famous red line in preventing Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from launching chemical weapons attacks against Syrian citizens in 2013. This created an opportune moment for Russia to launch a new strategic and somewhat pragmatic foreign policy in the Levant, through which it sought to carve out a space for itself in a changing order. Since then, Moscow has acted as a broker of sorts between different actors involved in the Syrian conflict, while balancing out its relationship with each actor in favor of its own national interests. In the process, it has sought to redefine a regional security architecture more amenable to these interests. Syria provided the opening for Moscow to demonstrate its revamped foreign policy. In 2013, President Vladimir Putin’s regime launched a major diplomatic initiative to disarm the Assad regime’s chemical arsenal, two years before its first direct military intervention in Syria in 2015 and two years after the death of Libya’s Muammar Gaddafi sent shockwaves in the Kremlin. Moscow’s military engagement in particular marked a more visibly interventionist approach to the region that was in line with a more globally assertive and expansionist Russian foreign policy, as was evident in its occupation of Georgian and Ukrainian territories in 2008 and 2014, respectively. Despite limitations in Russia’s ability to address the region’s most pressing issues, including the recurrent Israel-Palestine conflict in

Print KYIV -- Iryna was among dozens who gathered near a traffic junction to get a freshly cooked free meal on a recent afternoon. The 70-year-old used to work as a journalist but now, she says, with her modest pension and no help from her family, she comes here regularly. Most of those lining up for a helping of buckwheat with meat sauce, bread, and apples were either elderly, displaced, or disabled, Zhanna Tsvir, a volunteer of Sant'Egidio, the religious charity that brought in the food, told RFE/RL. "These are the unlucky ones," she said. An estimated 7.3 million Ukrainians face moderate or severe food insecurity, including 1.2 million children and 2 million elderly, according to an analysis by the United Nations. There is a high concentration of food-insecure people in the capital, but most of the affected are near the front lines, where approximately one-quarter of the population faces severe or extreme food deficits, the organization says. These numbers stand in contrast with Kyiv's bustling city center, with its packed restaurants, posh cars, and edgy street fashions. The Ukrainian economy has shown signs of recovery since the deep recession that followed the full-scale invasion in February 2022. After dropping by 30 percent in 2022, real GDP increased by 5.7 percent in 2023 and is expected to reach 3.5 percent this year. After spiking to over 26 percent in 2023, inflation decreased to some 4-5 percent annually. Food price inflation dropped from over 37 percent in late 2022 to some 5 percent today. The impact of war on different sectors of the economy and social groups is uneven, but the wartime impoverishment of large swathes of Ukrainian society is highlighted by data coming from a number of sources, Tymofiy Brik, a sociologist and rector of the Kyiv School of Economics, told RFE/RL. "Soon, socioeconomic conflicts may become a political factor for the first time in independent Ukraine," he said. The number of Ukrainians living in poverty has grown by 1.8 million since 2020, bringing the total to about 9 million, or 29 percent of the population living in the Kyiv-controlled territory, the World Bank said in a report published in May. The increase in poverty was driven mostly by job loss, with more than one-fifth of adults who were employed before the war having lost their jobs, a problem that is especially acute among the internally displaced (IDPs).

The conflict is a major blow to the global economy that will hurt growth and raise prices. Beyond the suffering and humanitarian crisis from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the entire global economy will feel the effects of slower growth and faster inflation. Impacts will flow through three main channels. One, higher prices for commodities like food and energy will push up inflation further, in turn eroding the value of incomes and weighing on demand. Two, neighboring economies in particular will grapple with disrupted trade, supply chains, and remittances as well as an historic surge in refugee flows. And three, reduced business confidence and higher investor uncertainty will weigh on asset prices, tightening financial conditions and potentially spurring capital outflows from emerging markets. Russia and Ukraine are major commodities producers, and disruptions have caused global prices to soar, especially for oil and natural gas. Food costs have jumped, with wheat, for which Ukraine and Russia make up 30 percent of global exports, reaching a record. Beyond global spillovers, countries with direct trade, tourism, and financial exposures will feel additional pressures. Economies reliant on oil imports will see wider fiscal and trade deficits and more inflation pressure, though some exporters such as those in the Middle East and Africa may benefit from higher prices. Steeper price increases for food and fuel may spur a greater risk of unrest in some regions, from Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America to the Caucasus and Central Asia, while food insecurity is likely to further increase in parts of Africa and the Middle East. Gauging these reverberations is hard, but we already see our growth forecasts as likely to be revised down next month when we will offer a fuller picture in our World Economic Outlook and regional assessments. Longer term, the war may fundamentally alter the global economic and geopolitical order should energy trade shift, supply chains reconfigure, payment networks fragment, and countries rethink reserve currency holdings. Increased geopolitical tension further raises risks of economic fragmentation, especially for trade and technology. Europe The toll is already immense in Ukraine. Unprecedented sanctions on Russia will impair financial intermediation and trade, inevitably causing a deep recession there. The ruble’s depreciation is fueling i

by LTC Amos C. Fox, USALand Warfare Paper 158, February 2024 Examining the strategic balance in the Russo-Ukrainian War leads to the conclusion that Russia has the upper hand. In 2024, Ukraine has limited prospects for overturning Russian territorial annexations and troop reinforcements of stolen territory. Ukraine’s ability to defend itself against Russian offensive action decreases as U.S. financial and materiel support decreases. Ukraine needs a significant increase in land forces to evict the occupying Russian land forces. The Russo-Ukrainian War is passing into its third year. In the period leading up to this point in the conflict, the defense and security studies community has been awash with arguments stating that the war is a stalemate. Perhaps the most compelling argument comes from General Valery Zaluzhny, former commander-in-chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, who stated as much in an interview with the Economist in November 2023.1 Meanwhile, there are others, including noted analyst Jack Watling, who emphatically state the opposite.2 Nonetheless, two years in, it is useful to objectively examine the conflict’s strategic balance. Some basic questions guide the examination, such as: is Ukraine winning, or is Russia winning? What does Ukraine need to defeat Russia, and conversely, what does Russia need to win in Ukraine? Moreover, aside from identifying who is winning or losing the conflict, it is important to identify salient trends that are germane not just within the context of the Russo-Ukrainian War, but that are applicable throughout the defense and security studies communities. This article addresses these questions through the use of the ends-ways-means-risk heuristic. In doing so, it examines Russia and Ukraine’s current strategic dispositions, and not what they were in February 2022, nor what we might want them to be. Viewing the conflict through the lens of preference and aspiration causes any analyst to misread the strategic situation. The goal of this article, however, is to take a sobering look at the realities of the conflict, offer an assessment of the situation, and posit where the conflict is likely to go in 2024. The overall conclusion is that Russia is winning the conflict. Russia is winning because it possesses its minimally acceptable outcome: the possession of the Donbas, of the land bridge to Crimea, and of Crimea itself. This v

Content:
International territorial administration has become a common feature of conflict zones around the world. Diplomatic efforts have played a critical role in preventing and resolving conflicts. Let's take a look at the importance of diplomacy and international relations in conflict resolution, and the challenges associated with sustained diplomatic efforts. In conflict zones, diplomacy is essential in preventing violence, protecting human rights, and promoting sustainable peace. Diplomats can help parties to a conflict understand each other's position and negotiate mutually acceptable solutions. Diplomatic efforts can help build trust between parties and prevent misunderstandings that can lead to violence. To resolve a conflict, it is essential to understand its underlying causes. Often, conflicts arise from complex historical, social, economic, and political factors. Diplomatic efforts can help parties to a conflict identify the root causes of their disputes and work toward solutions that address the underlying issues. In conflict zones, trust is often in short supply. Diplomatic efforts can help build trust between parties through dialogue, mutual respect, and compromise. Diplomats can facilitate communication between parties and help build bridges of understanding. The ultimate goal of diplomacy in conflict zones is to achieve sustainable peace. Diplomatic efforts can lead to agreements that promote peace and stability. These agreements should be designed to address the root causes of the conflict and promote social, economic, and political reconciliation. International relations play a significant role in preventing and resolving conflicts around the world. International organizations play a critical role in shaping foreign policy towards conflict zones, providing humanitarian aid and support, and negotiating diplomatic solutions through multilateral approaches. Foreign policy plays a significant role in shaping international relations and conflict resolution. Diplomats and policymakers must work together to identify strategies for addressing conflict zones and promoting peace. Foreign policy should be designed to promote human rights, democratic governance, and sustainable development.

Content:
Updated: Nov 13 Introduction Diplomatic endeavours and the dynamics of international relations are pivotal in averting and mitigating conflicts within global hotspots. Collaborative engagements between diplomats and policymakers is imperative in tackling underlying triggers of conflict and fostering enduring peace and progress. Consistent diplomatic initiatives, grounded in principles of openness, shared responsibility, and effective governance, are indispensable for ensuring enduring resolutions to conflicts. The role of diplomacy in resolving conflicts is a significant aspect of international relations and has been a subject of academic inquiry and practical application for centuries. Diplomacy, as a tool of statecraft, plays a crucial role in preventing, managing, and resolving conflicts between states and other actors in the international system. This essay aims to explore the multifaceted role of diplomacy in conflict resolution, examining its historical evolution, theoretical underpinnings, and practical applications in various conflict settings. Historical Evolution of Diplomacy in Conflict Resolution The historical evolution of diplomacy in conflict resolution can be traced back to ancient civilisations, where emissaries were sent to negotiate peace treaties and resolve disputes between warring states. The development of formal diplomatic institutions and practices can be observed in the city-states of ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, and the Chinese dynasties, Magadha, where envoys were appointed to engage in negotiations and mediation to prevent and resolve conflicts. With the advent of the modern era, the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 marked a significant milestone in the evolution of diplomacy and conflict resolution. This treaty not only ended the Thirty Years' War but also established the principles of state sovereignty and non-interference in the domestic affairs of other states. The emergence of the nation-state system further institutionalised diplomatic practices and provided a framework for managing interstate conflicts through negotiations, treaties, and alliances. Ancient Indian Diplomacy Indian civilisation has a long and elaborate tradition of diplomacy. India, being one of the oldest civilisations has evolved her statecraft, majorly relying upon the principles of Dharma or morality. The core of ancient Indian diplomacy was a civil stat

Research Focus: Humanitarian Crisis in Donbas Region

Content:
Russian President Vladimir Putin has recognized two separatist territories in eastern Ukraine as independent states, ordering the deployment of Russian troops there in a dangerous gambit that defies international law and risks a deadly military confrontation. The Kremlin’s decree recognizing the so-called Donetsk and Luhansk People’s Republics, in Ukraine’s eastern Donbas region, is a sharp escalation in a long-running conflict. For almost eight years the breakaway enclaves have been the site of a low-intensity war between Russian-backed separatists and Ukrainian forces which has left more than 14,000 people dead. But Putin’s decision to send forces into the area has raised fears of a broader war in Ukraine. Here’s a look at how the conflict started: War broke out in 2014 after Russian-backed rebels seized government buildings in towns and cities across eastern Ukraine. Intense fighting left portions of Luhansk and Donetsk, in the Donbas region, in the hands of Russian-backed separatists. Russia also annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 in a move that sparked global condemnation. The separatist-controlled areas in Donbas became known as the Luhansk and the Donetsk People’s Republics. The Ukrainian government in Kyiv asserts the two regions are, in effect, Russian-occupied. The self-declared republics are not recognized by any governments, other than Russia and its close ally Syria. The Ukrainian government refuses to talk directly with either separatist republic. Related article What does Putin want in Ukraine? The conflict explained The Minsk II agreement of 2015 led to a shaky ceasefire agreement, and the conflict settled into static warfare along the Line of Contact that separates the Ukrainian government and separatist-controlled areas. The Minsk Agreements (named after the capital of Belarus where they were concluded) ban heavy weapons near the Line of Contact. Language around the conflict is heavily politicized. The Ukrainian government calls separatist forces “invaders” and “occupiers.” Russian media calls separatist forces “militias” and maintains that they are locals defending themselves against the Kyiv government. More than 14,000 people have died in the conflict in Donbas since 2014. Ukraine says 1.5 million people have been forced to flee their homes, with most staying in the areas of Donbas that remain under Ukrainian control and about 200,000 r

Efforts to bring peace to Ukraine’s Donbas region have been deadlocked for years. The steps the belligerents take to de-escalate violence can save lives, but people still die on the front lines and beyond. Crisis Group’s new visual explainer puts these dynamics in stark relief. The war in eastern Ukraine began in March 2014. It pits separatists backed by Russia against the Ukrainian government in two industrial regions, Donetsk and Luhansk, which are part of an area known as Donbas. The war was ugliest in its first year, when battles raged for territory and strategic position. Two peace agreements – known as the Minsk agreements of 2014 and 2015 – put an end to the major fighting. They also laid out a roadmap for the reabsorption of the separatist-controlled regions into Ukraine, which calls, among other things, for Kyiv to grant these areas limited self-governing status. Implementation has stalled, however, and in the meantime some 75,000 troops – mostly Ukrainian citizens on both sides – still face off along a 450km front that cleaves Donbas in two. Some 800,000 civilians also live in the line of fire, while several million others reside in areas ridden with mines and unexploded shells. The death toll for the conflict creeps upward nearly every week and is now over 14,000. Crisis Group’s new interactive feature, “Conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas: A Visual Explainer”, maps both military and civilian casualties and illustrates the links between ceasefires and lulls in combat. It shows that ceasefires work – until they crack under the weight of deadlocked negotiations. It further shows that civilian casualties from live fire clearly correlate with intense combat in urban and suburban areas, falling to almost nil when ceasefires are in place. Civilian casualties from mines, however, do not correlate with whether or not a ceasefire is in place and have lately risen, likely due to increased foot traffic through heavily mined areas. Taken together, the data presented by this new explainer indicate that in the absence of a durable political solution, if the parties want to honour their stated intent to limit civilian casualties, they should commit to disengagement from high-traffic areas and to comprehensive demining. Both of these steps are hard sells to field commanders, for whom holding territory generally takes precedence. But disengagement is the only way to brin

Content:
Political rivalry in Cameroon has taken a worrying direction, as supporters of incumbent Paul Biya trade ethnic slurs with backers of his main political rival Maurice Kamto. The situation is threatening national stability by separatist insurgency in the Anglophone regions. Cameroon’s opposition leader Maurice Kamto continues to dispute the 2018 presidential election results, while his supporters and President Paul Biya’s exchange invective that often descends into ethnic slurs. The dispute uses online trolling campaign that is leading to violence. Maurice Kamto continues to challenge the vote’s outcome, while President Paul Biya shows no sign of wanting to relinquish power after 38 years in office. Biya is supported by Bulu ethnic group, indigenous to the Francophone South region, and the Beti of the Francophone Centre with whom the Bulu identify. Kamto is supported by Bamileke, indigenous to the Francophone West. The day after 2voting in 2018, Kamto declared himself winner, pre-empting the official result. Two weeks later, on October 22, 2018, the Constitutional Council, the only body with a legal mandate to announce results, proclaimed Biya winner with an overwhelming 71 per cent of the vote, with Kamto coming in second with only 14 per cent. Kamto himself seemed to reinforce an ethnic interpretation by suggesting he was denied victory in 2018 because of his ethnicity. Prior to announcing the results, the Constitutional Council heard and dismissed petitions in which two opposition candidates, Kamto and the SDF’s Joshua Osih, pleaded for an annulment on grounds of violence in the Anglophone regions, widespread fraud and incorrect tallies. Most non-partisan observers thought it likely that Biya had won more votes than any of his rivals, even if the president’s numbers were inflated, and foreign governments recognized his victory. However, the head of the country’s Catholic bishops’ conference, Bishop Samuel Kleda, expressed doubt about the president’s wide victory margin. The Catholic Church has five archdioceses in Cameroon— four French and one mostly English-speaking. Kamto, being a part of Cameroon’s Francophone majority, criticizes the government for holding elections in which few Anglophones could vote due to violence and a separatist-led boycott. He accuses Biya of mishandling the Anglophone crisis by prioritizing force over dialogue. In 1992, Maurice

Research Focus: The role of international involvement in shaping Ukraine's foreign policy
Source: https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/implication-russias-invasion-ukraines-foreign-policy
Content:
A blog of the Kennan Institute Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has had a profound impact on the design and conduct of Ukraine’s foreign policy. Not only has it changed the principles and worldviews on which Ukrainian foreign policy had always been built, it has also led to an overhaul of the mechanisms and instruments formerly used to promote the old political agenda. Ukraine’s Post-Soviet Foreign Policy For years, Ukraine’s foreign policy has bifurcated between the West and Russia, essentially remaining bipolar in a post-bipolar world order. In the 1990s and early 2000s, successive Ukrainian governments and elite financial groups didn’t believe a total war with Russia was possible and were focused on acquiring wealth and legitimacy through avenues available in the then existing international economic environment: attending to the huge post-Soviet markets, flirting frivolously with the ideas of Euro-Atlantic or Eurasian integration, engaging in various enrichment schemes for their personal commercial and political gain. But at least since the mid-2000s the situation has quietly evolved, while the Ukrainian elites have failed to grasp the moment and adequately assess its magnitude. The world financial crisis of 2008 dealt a heavy blow to Ukraine’s finances, while the rise of China and other regional economies has weakened domestic producers. As the U.S.-Russian rivalry intensified, the stable geopolitical balance on which the post–Cold War international order was based gradually began to erode. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the United States lost its status as the only superpower in the post–Cold War world, while Europe moved to a closer strategic energy partnership with Russia as the first step toward building an alternative Eurasian security architecture. The flow of petrodollars into Russian coffers in the 2000s allowed the Kremlin to accumulate enough resources to try to restore its hegemony in the post-Soviet region and launch a full-fledged expansion in the Ukrainian markets in 2006, which reached a peak during the presidency of Russia ally Viktor Yanukovych in 2010–2014. During these periods Ukraine’s foreign policy was inadequate to the emerging realities. Short-sighted, rigid, archaic, and highly personalized, it was often shaped by domestic political grievances, personal electoral agendas, and narrow business interests, w

Our editors will review what you’ve submitted and determine whether to revise the article. ethnic conflict, a form of conflict in which the objectives of at least one party are defined in ethnic terms, and the conflict, its antecedents, and possible solutions are perceived along ethnic lines. The conflict is usually not about ethnic differences themselves but over political, economic, social, cultural, or territorial matters. Ethnic conflict is one of the major threats to international peace and security. Conflicts in the Balkans, Rwanda, Chechnya, Iraq, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Darfur, as well as in Israel, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip, are among the best-known and deadliest examples from the late 20th and early 21st centuries. The destabilization of provinces, states, and, in some cases, even whole regions is a common consequence of ethnic violence. Ethnic conflicts are often accompanied by gross human rights violations, such as genocide and crimes against humanity, and by economic decline, state failure, environmental problems, and refugee flows. Violent ethnic conflict leads to tremendous human suffering. The terms ethnic and ethnicity have their roots in the Greek word ethnos, which describes a community of common descent. In ethnic conflict research, the terms ethnic group, communal group, ethnic community, people, and minority are mostly used interchangeably. Two elements provide the basis to identify ethnic groups: first, the accentuation of cultural traits and, second, the sense that those traits distinguish the group from the members of the society who do not share the differentiating characteristics. Anthony D. Smith, a scholar of ethnicity and nationalism studies, identified ethnic criteria that provide the origins of communal identity. Those include shared historical experiences and memories, myths of common descent, a common culture and ethnicity, and a link with a historic territory or a homeland, which the group may or may not currently inhabit. Elements of common culture include language, religion, laws, customs, institutions, dress, music, crafts, architecture, and even food. Ethnic communities show signs of solidarity and self-awareness, which are often expressed by the name the group gives itself. Ethnic identity is formed by both tangible and intangible characteristics. Tangible characteristics, such as shared culture or com

Research Focus: Economic factors, including sanctions and trade disruptions
Source: https://www.economicsobservatory.com/how-are-geopolitical-risks-affecting-the-world-economy
Content:
Geopolitical risks posed by elections, polarisation and conflicts within and between states have inevitable knock-on effects on the economy, both globally and for individual countries. This year more than ever, managing these risks and shoring up institutions that promote stability are essential. The war in Ukraine and the conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Middle East – further complicated by Houthi missile attacks on ships in the Red Sea – highlight the extent to which geopolitical developments are a key determinant of global economic performance in 2024. Elections around the world are also likely to have a significant impact on the direction of the global economy. With at least 64 countries going to the polls, this effect will be seen not only through potential changes in trade and investment policies but also by increased uncertainty and political polarisation. The term geopolitics denotes a broad analytical framework in international relations, encompassing different phenomena such as political instability, tensions and military conflicts between countries, terrorist threats or geographical events that can have regional or global impacts. The global economy can be affected by geopolitical events both directly and indirectly through financial, trade and commodity price channels. In terms of financial markets, this happens both through direct capital controls or financial sanctions, and indirectly through increased uncertainty, higher risk premia or asset price surges (Catalán et al, 2023). On the trade side, increased restrictions due to tensions between countries can disrupt trade flows and cause supply chain problems even in third-party countries. Restrictions can also affect commodity prices and lead to shortages of key resources such as oil and gas, affecting industrial production worldwide. Taken together and mutually reinforcing each other, the global economy can experience higher inflation, lower growth and significant welfare losses in times of geopolitical tension (Góes and Bekkers, 2022). The term geopolitics is also used in the context of internal political affairs, which can influence domestic and global financial markets. In this sense, governments can influence economic activity through various fiscal policies (taxes and spending), and economic and strategic decisions based on different priorities, depending on their political orienta

Research Focus: The impact of Russian military intervention on the conflict dynamics
Source: https://www.marshallcenter.org/en/publications/perspectives/stability-challenges-and-opportunities-regarding-russo-ukrainian-war-0
Content:
The United States must punish Russia’s aggression and violent actions on Ukraine. Raymond A. Millen Russian President Vladimir Putin’s aggression on Ukraine raises a number of issues regarding the future stability in Europe and the international system. The Russian invasion is a direct challenge to international rule of law and stability of the international system. Specifically, it has violated the 1994 Budapest Memorandum, in which the Russian Federation reaffirmed Ukrainian independence, sovereignty, and border integrity.1 A failure to respond to Russian aggression is appeasement and an incentive to further erode the international system. Consequently, the international community must take measures to moderate Russian aberrant foreign policy and uphold the global order. A key factor in this conflict is recognizing the limitations of Russian military power and the critical role the energy sector plays in the global balance of power and stability.2 Military experts assume that great powers with sophisticated militaries will always prevail in conflicts,3 but history suggests this conclusion is not always the case (e.g., U.S. War of Independence, the Russo-German War, and the Vietnam War). So far, Russian military operations have been unwieldy and savage. The farther west the Russian military advances, the greater its difficulties will multiply. The United States must formally acknowledge the threat and lead a defensive Allied coalition to counter and punish Russia aggression. A U.S.-led coalition need not invoke an open conflict. Rather, the confrontation can remain below the threshold of general war by astutely employing the instruments of power (diplomatic, information/psychological, military, and economic). Accordingly, the Ukrainian government and military should remain at the forefront of the coalition. Because Putin’s prestige and even political survival is at stake, the war will likely continue until the Ukraine is defeated and occupied, or Russia is defeated and withdraws completely. This paper touches on the significance of the conflict on international stability, the significant military challenges of the Russian military as the fighting continues, and the opportunities to restore European and international stability in response to Russian aggression. The conflict will be protracted and devastating for the Ukraine, and the aftershocks to internatio

Research Focus: International Relations and Diplomacy
Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_relations
Content:
International relations (IR, and also referred to as international studies, international politics,[2] or international affairs[3]) is an academic discipline.[4] In a broader sense, the study of IR, in addition to multilateral relations, concerns all activities among states—such as war, diplomacy, trade, and foreign policy—as well as relations with and among other international actors, such as intergovernmental organizations (IGOs), international nongovernmental organizations (INGOs), international legal bodies, and multinational corporations (MNCs).[5][6] International relations is generally classified as a major multidiscipline of political science, along with comparative politics, political methodology, political theory, and public administration.[7][8] It often draws heavily from other fields, including anthropology, economics, geography, history, law, philosophy, and sociology.[9] There are several schools of thought within IR, of which the most prominent are realism, liberalism, and constructivism. While international politics has been analyzed since antiquity, it did not become a discrete field until 1919, when it was first offered as an undergraduate major by Aberystwyth University in the United Kingdom.[7][10] The Second World War and its aftermath provoked greater interest and scholarship in international relations, particularly in North America and Western Europe, where it was shaped considerably by the geostrategic concerns of the Cold War. The collapse of the Soviet Union and subsequent rise of globalization in the late 20th century have presaged new theories and evaluations of the rapidly changing international system.[11] Depending on the academic institution, international relations or international affairs is either a subdiscipline of political science or a broader multidisciplinary field encompassing global politics, law, economics or world history. As a subdiscipline of political science, the focus of IR studies lies on political, diplomatic and security connections among states, as well as the study of modern political world history. In many academic institutions, studies of IR are thus situated in the department of politics/social sciences. This is for example the case in Scandinavia, where international relations are often simply referred to as international politics (IP).[citation needed] In institutions where international relations r

(Photo by Staff Sgt. Nicolas A. Cloward, U.S. Army) The primary purpose of any theory is to clarify concepts and ideas that have become, as it were, confused and entangled. —Carl von Clausewitz Many field grade officers and Command and General Staff Officers’ Course (CGSOC) students have difficulty distinguishing between the levels of war. This article attempts to clarify the levels of war by proposing that they should be thought of as levels of analysis. Many disciplines have found utility in using levels of analysis to clarify thinking and as an approach to research and analysis. It seems reasonable to believe that approaching the levels of war as levels of analysis will do the same for CGSOC students. The advantages of this approach will be discerned by looking at the levels of war and common issues students have with them, the levels of analysis framework (to include the unit of analysis issue), and the benefits of using the levels of war as levels of analysis to clarify thinking. The concept of levels of war has a long history, starting with Carl von Clausewitz, who identified two levels: strategy and tactics.1 Aleksandr A. Svechin, an officer in the 1920s Soviet Red Army, first proposed the concept of an operational level of war.2 However, the U.S. Army did not adopt the operational level of war as doctrine until 1982 in Field Manual 100-5, Operations.3 Current doctrine regarding the levels of war can be found in both Joint Publication (JP) 1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, and JP 3-0, Joint Operations.4

Research Focus: Human Rights and Civilian Displacement

Content:
A staggering 85 per cent of the total population of Gaza — 1.9 million civilians — have been forcibly displaced amid Israel’s military operations, the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator told the Security Council today, as delegates categorically rejected any statements proposing that Palestinians should be resettled outside of Gaza, including from members of the Israeli Government. Martin Griffiths, Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, painted a grim picture of the horrific situation in Gaza, where more than 23,000 people have been killed and more than 58,000 injured since 7 October. Shelters are overflowing, food and water running out, the risk of famine growing by the day and the health system collapsing, with winter “exacerbating the struggle to survive”. Describing as “deplorable” that facilities critical to the survival of civilians have come under relentless attack, he said that, as ground operations move southwards, aerial bombardments have intensified in areas where civilians were told to relocate for their safety. “More and more people are being crammed into an ever-smaller sliver of land, only to find yet more violence and deprivation, inadequate shelter and a near absence of the most basic services,” he continued. “There is no safe place in Gaza” and dignified human life is “a near impossibility,” he said, adding: “Even if people were able to return home, many no longer have homes to go to.” Warning that the spread of hostilities further southwards would significantly increase pressure for the mass displacement of people into neighbouring countries, he firmly rejected any attempt to change the demographic composition of Gaza. Ilze Brands Kehris, Assistant Secretary-General for Human Rights, recalled that massive displacement in the enclave commenced on 12 October 2023, with Israel ordering Palestinian civilians north of the Wadi Gaza to vacate their homes and go south. However, such compelled evacuation failed to comply with international law and could amount to forcible transfer — a war crime, she asserted. Warning against the risks of further massive displacement — potentially even beyond Gaza’s borders — she said incendiary statements by some members of Israel’s leadership pushing for permanent resettlement of Palestinians overseas have entrenched fears that Palestinians are being deliberat

Content:
Israel has overseen the forced mass displacement of Palestinians in Gaza in a deliberate and systematic campaign that amounts to a war crime and a crime against humanity, according to a new Human Rights Watch report. The 154-page report, published by the US-based advocacy group on Thursday, details more than 13 months of widespread destruction in Gaza that, according to the United Nations, has seen the displacement of about 1.9 million Palestinians – more than 90% of the territory’s population. In a statement, Human Rights Watch (HRW) cited the illegal and “deliberate, controlled demolitions of homes and civilian infrastructure,” by Israeli forces in Gaza “where they have apparent aims of creating ‘buffer zones’ and security ‘corridors,’ from which Palestinians are likely to be permanently displaced.” “The Israeli government cannot claim to be keeping Palestinians safe when it kills them along escape routes, bombs so-called safe zones, and cuts off food, water, and sanitation,” said Nadia Hardman, a HRW refugee and migrant rights researcher. “Israel has blatantly violated its obligation to ensure Palestinians can return home, razing virtually everything in large areas.” In a response to the report on Thursday, the Israeli military said it is “committed to international law and operates accordingly,” and that it issues evacuation orders to protect civilians from combat. The Israeli military also denied there was any “doctrine that aims causing maximal damage to civilian infrastructure regardless of military necessity,” and said any “reports and complaints regarding the violation of international law” are referred to an internal review body. Israel has been accused by multiple human rights groups – and UN investigators – of military conduct that could amount to war crimes over the past year, which it has vociferously denied. Hamas has also been accused of war crimes. In October, a UN inquiry said Israel had a “concerted policy” of destroying the health care system in Gaza in what it said amounted to war crimes. The Israeli foreign ministry called those accusations “outrageous” and said they were “another blatant attempt by the (commission) to delegitimize the very existence of the State of Israel and obstruct its right to protect its population while covering up the crimes of terrorist organizations.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously sa

Research Focus: Economic Factors and Sanctions

Content:
When foreign countries engage in activities that threaten U.S. interests, the U.S. government can impose economic sanctions. For example, the United States may prohibit certain exports or freeze a foreign entity’s U.S. assets to try to stop weapons proliferation or human rights abuses. The Departments of State, Commerce, and the Treasury have assessed sanctions’ impacts—for example, on a targeted country’s economy or trade. But they haven’t determined whether sanctions really work—nor are the agencies required to do so. Academic studies show sanctions are more effective when they’re implemented through an international organization like the UN. Country-Based and Country-Related U.S. Sanctions Programs, as of July 2019 Map with various countries shaded The Departments of the Treasury (Treasury), State (State), and Commerce (Commerce) each undertake efforts to assess the impacts of specific sanctions on the targets of those sanctions. For example, Treasury and State both analyze or compile information on sanctions programs' impacts, such as on a target country's economy. In addition, Commerce assesses prospective impacts of some sanctions on targeted countries and others. According to Treasury and State officials, the agencies also use Intelligence Community assessments to gauge sanctions' impacts. However, agency officials cited several difficulties in assessing sanctions' effectiveness in meeting broader U.S. policy goals, including challenges in isolating the effect of sanctions from other factors as well as evolving foreign policy goals. According to Treasury, State, and Commerce officials, their agencies have not conducted such assessments on their own. However, they stated that agency assessments of sanctions' impacts often contribute to broader interagency discussions that examine the effectiveness of sanctions in achieving policy goals. Country-Based and Country-Related U.S. Economic Sanctions Programs as of July 2019 The academic studies GAO reviewed suggest that several factors have contributed to more-effective sanctions. Studies examining factors that contribute to the effectiveness of sanctions in changing targeted countries' behavior provided evidence that sanctions have been more effective when (1) they were implemented through an international organization (e.g., the United Nations) or (2) the targeted countries had some existing dependency on,
