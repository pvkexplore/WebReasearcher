The phrase "Hello, World!" originated in the late 1970s when Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie wrote a simple example program for their book "The C Programming Language". This program printed the words "Hello, World" to the console. The main function defined where the program should start executing, with a single statement that called the `printf()` function, which outputs to the console whatever was passed as an argument.

The phrase gained popularity in the 1970s and early 1980s when programming languages such as C were gaining traction. As these languages became more widely used, the "Hello, World!" program became a standard test of whether someone knew how to use them. The simplicity of the phrase made it easy for new programmers to understand and write their first programs.

The phrase was also influenced by earlier examples in programming books, such as Kernighan's own book "Programming in C: A Tutorial". However, the "Hello, World!" program itself is often credited with being written in the late 1970s, likely due to an example from a book that appeared around 1978.

The phrase has since become an iconic part of programming culture and has been used in various contexts beyond just writing programs. It has also been referenced in popular media, such as movies and books, and is often seen as a symbol of the beginning of a programmer's journey.

In terms of its significance, "Hello, World!" serves several purposes. Firstly, it provides a simple way to test programming environments and ensure that they are working correctly. Secondly, it is often used as a tool for testing and verifying the functionality of other programs. Finally, its universal appeal has made it a cultural icon, appearing in various forms of media and reflecting the imagination of programmers and non-programmers alike.

In terms of its place in programming history, "Hello, World!" emerged at a time when programming languages were becoming increasingly popular. As these languages gained traction, the phrase became an important part of their development and adoption. Today, it remains an essential tool for new programmers to learn how to write their first programs and is widely recognized as an iconic symbol of the beginning of a programmer's journey.

The phrase "Hello World!" originated during the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel in 1973. Brothers Brian and Michael McCormack, who were journalists at the time, wrote over 1,360 letters to world leaders, asking them to solve conflicts through dialogue rather than violence.

These letters were an attempt to promote peace and understanding among nations. The brothers' initiative was inspired by the concept of Yom Kippur, a Jewish holiday that marks the day of atonement for sins committed during the previous year. Similarly, they sought to encourage leaders to seek peaceful solutions to conflicts.

The McCormack brothers' letters were distributed to world leaders and reached over 180 countries, making "Hello World!" one of the first global events focused on promoting peace through dialogue. Since then, the phrase has become synonymous with the idea that simple acts of greeting can contribute to a more peaceful world by bridging cultural gaps.

The initiative gained international recognition, with several Nobel Peace Prize winners and notable personalities endorsing it. The concept of "Hello World!" has since been replicated in various forms around the world, emphasizing the importance of interpersonal communication in promoting peace and understanding.

The phrase "Hello World!" originated in 1973 during the Yom Kippur War between Egypt and Israel. It was created by brothers Brian and Michael McCormack, who were part of a secret operation to promote peace through interpersonal communication. The idea was simple yet profound: encourage people to greet ten people they don't know on November 21st every year.

The concept is based on the idea that breaking down barriers and fostering dialogue can lead to lasting peace. By simply saying "hello" to someone, it acknowledges their existence and initiates a conversation, which can spark new friendships and even lead to collaborations that change the world.

This initiative has gained significant traction over the years, with numerous endorsements from notable personalities such as Nobel Peace Prize laureates, public figures, and celebrities who support peace through simple acts of greeting and communication. Organizations and community leaders around the globe have also endorsed World Hello Day, highlighting its message of fostering interpersonal connections as a non-violent means of solving conflicts.

The act of saying "hello" has a profound impact on individuals and communities. It can boost our mood, reduce feelings of isolation, and even lead to positive changes in our emotional state. Studies have shown that social interaction is crucial for mental well-being, and brief encounters can have a significant difference in someone's day, especially for those who may feel isolated or disconnected.

The significance of World Hello Day lies not only in its impact on individuals but also in its global appeal. It transcends cultural and linguistic differences, uniting people under a common goal of peace and understanding. By celebrating this simple act of greeting, we can contribute to a more peaceful and interconnected world, one "hello" at a time.

The phrase "Hello World!" has a fascinating history that began in the early days of computing and programming.

"Hello World!" was first introduced by Richard T. Taylor, an American computer scientist, in his 1974 paper titled "Introduction to Algorithms." In this paper, Taylor demonstrated how to write a simple program that prints "Hello, World!" to the screen using the BASIC programming language, which was then developed at Bell Labs.

Taylor's work built upon earlier research by John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz, who created a programming language called PLATO (Plankalkül) in 1958. PLATO was designed for teaching computer science students, but its limitations led to the development of more powerful languages like FORTRAN and COBOL.

The first version of "Hello World!" was written in PLATO using the PLATO BASIC compiler, which was developed by Robert J. Zale (also known as Bob Zale) at Bell Labs in 1973. The original code consisted of only three lines: "PRINT 'HELLO WORLD!'" followed by a period.

Zale's work on "Hello World!" was an important milestone in the development of programming languages and computer science education. Over time, "Hello World!" has become a ubiquitous phrase that is used to introduce new programming concepts, languages, and software systems.

The term "Hello World" gained widespread usage after IBM released its first commercial PC in 1981, which included a built-in BASIC interpreter. As the popularity of PCs grew, so did the use of "Hello World!" as a teaching tool for beginners.

In recent years, "Hello World!" has continued to evolve, with new versions and interpretations emerging in various programming languages and platforms. However, Robert Zale's original work on the phrase remains an important part of computer science history and is still widely used today.

The scraped content also mentions that Vivian Zale, Bob Zale's wife, posted a statement on the PowerBASIC forums in 2014 confirming the company's continued operation after Robert Zale's death. In January 2017, Adam Drake acquired the source code of PowerBASIC from PowerBASIC Inc., with the intention of updating and improving the product.

Despite development stalling, no new version of "Hello World!" has been released since v10.03 (11 years ago). The scraped content also notes that PowerBASIC Tools LLC still sells new licenses for old versions of the software.

The question "what can you do?" seems to be a call for action or an invitation for the reader to take a specific step.

From the scraped content, it appears that the reader is aware of the issue with Idaho's funding for education and the proposal to hand out vouchers to private schools. However, instead of simply expressing frustration or disappointment, the reader seems to want to inspire or mobilize others to take action.

The most relevant information from the scraped content is likely the following:

* Idaho has a rainy day fund of approximately $1.3 billion.
* The Department of Education will not fully fund public education, but vouchers for private schools may be offered in the next legislative session.
* There is a broader issue at stake: a crusade against ignorance and an emphasis on educating the common people.

Given this context, it seems that the reader might suggest ways to address these issues or take action. Here are some possible answers:

1. Educate yourself and others about the importance of public education funding and the potential consequences of handouts.
2. Contact representatives in the next legislative session to express concerns about vouchers for private schools and propose alternative solutions, such as increasing funding for public schools.
3. Support organizations that work to promote public education and address issues related to ignorance and inequality.
4. Advocate for policies that prioritize education and funding for public schools over voucher programs.

Overall, it seems that the question "what can you do?" is an invitation for readers to take action or engage in a specific effort to address these issues.

The "AWS Q" referred to in the question appears to be a quarterly earnings report by Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is its cloud-computing business. According to the scraped content, AWS generated $1.43 in earnings per share on $158.9 billion in overall revenue for the quarter, beating analyst estimates.

The key highlights of the report are:

* Operating income grew 50% year over year to $10.4 billion.
* Revenue in the AWS business rose 19% from the same period a year earlier to $27.5 billion, in line with analyst expectations.
* The operating profit margin accelerated from 30% in the same period last year to 38%.
* One of the key areas that stood out is the growth of Amazon's generative AI business, which has been growing more than 100% year over year.

It is worth noting that the report mentions AWS's multibillion-dollar generative AI business, but does not provide further details on how it will develop into a larger piece of the overall AWS business. Additionally, the report does not mention any specific information about capital expenditures or the potential impact of AI investments on Amazon's earnings.

To summarize, the "AWS Q" refers to Amazon Web Services' quarterly earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, which showed strong revenue growth and record operating income, with a focus on the company's cloud-computing business.

You are "Who Are You", the eighth studio album by the English rock band The Who, released on August 18, 1978, in the United Kingdom by Polydor Records and August 21, 1978, in the United States by MCA Records. This album was a commercial success, peaking at number 2 on the US charts and number 6 on the UK charts.

The Who's final studio album to feature Keith Moon as their drummer, he died three weeks after its release. The album incorporates elements of progressive rock and includes some of Townshend's most complicated arrangements with multiple layers of synthesizer and strings. Some songs also revisit themes from The Who's never realized Lifehouse project, featuring lyrics about songwriting and music as a metaphor for life.

The album was produced in such a way to appeal to commercial rock radio at the time. Many of the songs also reflect Townshend's uncertainty about the band's continued relevance in the wake of punk rock, and his dissatisfaction with the music industry. Some of the lyrics suggest that Townshend is uncertain about The Who's future, while others express concern for Moon's health due to his deteriorating drumming skills.

The initial sessions at Ramport Studios were lackadaisical, with some members looking forward more to drinking and reminiscing than working on the album. Jon Astley felt that he and Glyn Johns pushed Keith Moon too hard to play a simpler style, while John believed that Keith had "lost confidence in his ability" and would deliberately resist suggestions.

The health of The Who's drummer was especially an object of concern during this period, as his drumming skills had noticeably deteriorated. This has been noted by some critics and biographers.

The "AWS Q" referred to in the question appears to be a feature within Amazon Q Developer, which is an expanded resource-awareness tool. Here's a comprehensive answer based on the provided scraped content:

Amazon Q Developer offers context-aware assistance for resources in your account by providing information about relationships between account resources. This feature allows users to ask questions and receive relevant responses from the console.

In addition to natural language processing capabilities, Amazon Q Developer can also provide context-aware assistance for your questions about specific resources in your AWS account. The provided example illustrates this functionality:

* A developer uses Amazon Q Developer to list all their EC2 instances ( Figure 1: Amazon Q Developer listing EC2 instances needing an update )
* With the expanded support, a developer can ask a more complex question like "Which RDS clusters are due for an update?" and receive a list of all available updates as shown in Figure 1 above.

Regarding updating Lambda functions that had Simple Notification Service (SNS) topics as triggers, Amazon Q Developer can help by listing all the SNS topics that trigger lambdai ( Figure 2: Amazon Q Developer listing Lambdas with updated information on SNS topic usage ).

The farthest known object in the universe is a galaxy named GN-z11, which is located approximately 13.4 billion light-years away from Earth.

According to the article on List of the most distant astronomical objects at Wikipedia, this galaxy was observed through the Hubble Space Telescope and its position was measured as a "redshift" or "stretching" of light emitted by the galaxy, indicating that it is moving away from us. However, because of the expansion of the universe, we can't directly measure how far it is; instead, we calculate its distance based on how much the light has stretched due to the universe's expansion.

The article states that the proper distance (the distance in which time and space are frozen at a fixed moment) for GN-z11 would be 13.4 billion years of travel for light emitted by the galaxy. This means that if we were able to freeze time, we could walk all the way to GN-z11 from Earth while observing the light it emits.

The proper distance represents how far away the galaxy is at a fixed moment in time. The article notes that this value equals the cosmological scale factor of one (a(t0) = 1), indicating that time and space are effectively frozen for GN-z11, allowing us to calculate its distance accurately using the FLRW metric.

It's worth noting that while GN-z11 is considered the most distant known object, there may be other objects even farther away. However, as of now, it holds the record for the greatest distance from Earth.

The longest road on the planet is the Pan-American Highway, which stretches across the entire Americas, from its Northern Tip in Prudhoe Bay, Alaska, to Ushuaia in Argentina. It spans a total length of approximately 48,000 kilometers (30,000 miles), making it not only the longest motorable road but also the longest road on the planet.

The Pan-American Highway is a network of highways that links all of the Pacific continental states in an interlinked system of domestic and international roads. It passes through several countries, including Canada, Mexico, United States, Belize, Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Argentina, and Uruguay.

The road is a Guinness Book World Record Holder for the Longest Motorable Road in the world. It includes unofficial sections prior to 1966, with a total length of approximately 48,000 kilometers (30,000 miles). The highway also passes through various terrain types, including deserts, mountains, and rainforests.

The Katy Freeway, or I-10, in Texas is the widest road in the world, with 26 lanes. This road is one of the longest stretches of metal tarred roads in the world, stretching for approximately 1,900 kilometers (1,180 miles).

The first ever chess tournament was held in London in May, 1851. The tournament was devised and organized by English chess champion Howard Staunton, who created a format that included a "Chess Parliament" to standardize rules and create a compendium of chess openings. Staunton's decision to hold the tournament in London may have been influenced by the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was held in the city at the same time.

The first international chess tournament took place in London in May, 1851. The event featured a competition of sixteen players from Europe, including Adolf Anderssen, who won the title of world's best player with his performance in the competition. However, it is worth noting that there are no details provided about the winner or the rules of play.

The tournament was organized by Captain Hugh Alexander Kennedy and other chess enthusiasts, and its goal was to standardize rules and create a compendium of chess openings. Staunton recommended creating a "Chess Parliament" to deal with minor national discrepancies and self-contradictions in the game.

Additionally, the Great Exhibition of 1851 provided an opportunity for London's chess community to come together and promote the game, which may have influenced the decision to hold the international tournament. The event was also notable for its emphasis on standardization and competition, with Staunton advocating for a "Chess Parliament" to oversee the rules of play.

The details mentioned in the scraped content provide some insight into the events surrounding the first international chess tournament, but there is no mention of the winner or the specific outcomes of the competition.

The question asked how many days in an year we can see Jupiter in the sky?

According to the scraped content, the available information does not provide a clear answer to this question. The "days between dates calculator" on Gigacalculator.com is used to calculate the number of days between two dates, but it does not specifically address the visibility of Jupiter.

The available information from Timeanddate.com states that today (no specific date mentioned) and the need for help are related to calculating deadlines or exact dates. There is no mention of Jupiter's visibility in the sky.

Therefore, I must say that I do not have enough information to provide a definitive answer to this question.

Handling frustration when debugging and fixing issues can be challenging, especially in open-source software development. According to the text, Linux kernel was designed by Linus Torvalds following the lack of a working kernel for GNU, which had been undergoing development since 1983. While a separate working Unix-compatible system called Minix was later released, its license was not entirely free at the time.

Linux did not have any Unix code and therefore required significant efforts to create an operating system that could run on various platforms, including personal computers. Torvalds' release of the first version of the Linux kernel on the Internet in 1992 marked a significant milestone in the development of the operating system. However, this was also after the lack of a working kernel for GNU.

The Linux community is known to be active and collaborative, with many distributions using the word "Linux" in their name but emphasizing the importance of GNU software. This has led to some controversy over time, as some argue that the use of "GNU/Linux" can be misleading.

In general, debugging and fixing issues in open-source software development requires persistence, patience, and a willingness to learn from others. It's essential to gather information, analyze data, and seek help when needed. The Linux community is known for its transparency and openness, which can be beneficial in finding solutions to problems.

However, debugging and fixing issues can also be frustrating due to the complexity of open-source software development. Debugging requires careful analysis of code, system calls, and configuration options, which can be time-consuming and challenging. Fixing issues often involves resolving conflicts between different components or subsystems, such as kernel bugs, package manager errors, or system software malfunctions.

To overcome frustration while debugging and fixing issues in Linux, it's essential to:

1. Stay calm and focused
2. Gather information from various sources, including documentation, forums, and online communities
3. Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks
4. Collaborate with other developers or experts when needed
5. Be patient and persistent in the face of challenges

By following these steps, it's possible to effectively debug and fix issues in Linux while maintaining a healthy mindset and approach.

The greatest Chinese king mentioned in the scraped content is Yu the Great (also referred to as Yu Ziyu), who is conventionally regarded as the inaugurator of dynastic rule in China. According to Wikipedia, Yu was a king of the Xia dynasty and is believed to have reigned from around 2100 BC to 2051 BC.

Yu's reign marked the beginning of dynastic rule in China, with the establishment of the Xia dynasty. The scraped content does not provide further information on Yu's achievements or accomplishments during his reign.

In addition, it is mentioned that Yu was a member of the royal family and reigned according to the traditional hereditary monarch system. This means that he inherited the throne through his father, King Tang, and later became king himself after his father's death.

The scraped content also mentions that Yu's rule lasted for approximately 41 years, during which time he implemented various reforms and policies that had a significant impact on Chinese society at that time. However, this information is not directly related to Yu being considered the greatest Chinese king in the context of dynastic history.

Therefore, based on the available information from the scraped content, it can be concluded that Yu the Great is considered one of the most important and influential Chinese kings due to his role as the inaugurator of dynastic rule and his lasting impact on Chinese society.

The plants that are highly poisonous are:

* Poison ivy (Rhus dermatitis)
* Poison oak (Rhus dermatitis)
* Poison sumac (Rhus vernix)

These plants produce urushiol, an oil that causes a skin rash in people who come into contact with its leaves, stems, or roots. The rash is typically red, itchy, and swollen, and can also have hives or blisters.

The leaflets of poison ivy and oak are typically glossy and rounded to multiple jagged edges, which change color depending on the season. They may be reddish in the spring, green in the summer, yellow, orange, or red in the fall, and sometimes have black dots. The plants can also produce berries that range from yellowish white, orange, red, or yellowish green.

Poison ivy typically grows as a vine or shrub in most parts of the United States, with the exception of Alaska, Hawaii, and certain areas along the West Coast. Poison oak is similar to poison ivy but typically has three leaflets that grow on each leaf.

The question asked about which vegetables can be harmful for certain people. The scraped content provides information on two different websites related to vegetables and their safety.

From the first website, it states that some vegetables may prevent stomach problems, but proper vegetable preparation and identification can also keep you from becoming paralyzed, having seizures, or needing a liver transplant. However, improper preparation of dangerous vegetables can lead to death's door.

Specifically, it mentions that rhubarb leaves are toxic due to their high content of oxalic acid, which can cause kidney stones, seizures, coma, and even death if consumed in large doses (up to 825 milligrams per pound a person weighs).

In contrast, the second website suggests that some vegetables may be safer than others. According to this site, strawberries are at the top of the list for highest pesticide residues when purchased conventionally. Spinach is also one of the healthiest vegetables and comes in second on the list.

However, it notes that high pesticide exposure has been related to a wide range of harmful health effects, including cancer, hormone disruption, and potential damage to a child's developing brain and nervous system. These pesticides could potentially cause harm to individuals with certain health conditions or those who are young.

The second website also mentions that 92% of conventionally-grown kale samples contained at least two different forms of pesticides. However, it emphasizes the importance of eating fruits and vegetables regardless of whether they're conventional or organic because they provide a crucial part of a healthy diet.

In terms of specific vegetables to avoid due to pesticide exposure, the second website recommends staying away from caned products that may contain high levels of pesticide residues.

To get started with building home automation, you can follow these options for beginners:

1. Start by creating a new React project using the command `npx create-react-app my-home-automation` (replace "my-home-automation" with your desired app name). This will set up a basic React project structure and environment.
2. Learn the basics of JSX, which is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code in your JavaScript files. You can use online resources such as MDN and javascript.info to learn more about JSX.
3. Familiarize yourself with component lifecycle methods, such as `componentDidMount()`, `componentDidUpdate()`, and `componentWillUnmount()`. These methods allow you to perform actions when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.
4. Learn how to use state variables in React by creating a simple component that displays data from an API call, such as `apiData = { id: 1, name: "John" }`.
5. Understand the importance of CSS classes and how to apply them to your components using the `className` property.
6. Learn about props, which are immutable objects passed from a parent component to a child component. Props can be used to pass data between components or to configure their behavior.
7. Familiarize yourself with React hooks, such as `useState()`, which allows you to manage state in functional components.

Some recommended resources for learning home automation using React include:

* The official React documentation
* Online courses and tutorials on websites like Udemy, FreeCodeCamp, or Coursera
* Communities and forums, such as Reddit's r/learnprogramming or Stack Overflow

Remember that building a home automation system can be complex, and it may take time to develop the necessary skills. However, following these steps and learning from resources will help you get started on your journey.

To get started with building home automation, you can follow these steps:

1. Start by creating a new folder in your web browser's files called "scripts". Within this folder, create a new text document called `main.js`.
2. In the `main.js` file, enter the following code: `<script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){console.log("Hello World!");});</script>`
3. Save the changes to the `main.js` file and open the HTML file.
4. Add the JavaScript code to the head section of the HTML file, just before the closing </head> tag: `<head><script>document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){console.log("Hello World!");});</script></head>`
5. Save the changes to the HTML file.

As a beginner, you don't need any special tools or software to start building home automation projects. You can use your web browser's JavaScript console to execute the above code and test its functionality.

The options for beginners in home automation include:

* Using online resources such as W3Schools' free "My Learning" program to track progress and earn points.
* Practicing with simple scripts and exercises provided by the website.
* Studying JavaScript basics through online tutorials and courses, such as those offered on W3Schools.
* Experimenting with home automation projects using pre-built libraries and frameworks, such as Node.js or Python.

These resources can help beginners build a strong foundation in JavaScript and gain hands-on experience with home automation concepts.

The Ukraine conflict is a complex issue with multiple factors contributing to its ongoing nature. According to the scraped content, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has neither confirmed nor denied a strike by Ukraine on Russia's Bryansk region. However, he did state that Kyiv would use all its long-range capabilities in its arsenal.

The United States has given Ukraine the green light to use longer-range American weapons inside Russia, which may have contributed to the escalation of the conflict. This development is significant as it allows Ukrainian forces to potentially target Russian military installations and personnel with increased precision.

Additionally, Russian President Vladimir Putin has updated his country's nuclear doctrine to consider aggression from any non-nuclear state, including a joint attack on Russia, through the participation of a nuclear country. This shift in policy may indicate that Moscow is more willing to engage in conventional military action against Ukraine or other countries, which could further exacerbate the conflict.

It is essential to note that the Ukrainian conflict has been ongoing for 1,000 days, with no clear resolution in sight. The situation remains volatile, and it is unclear whether a lasting peace can be achieved.

To make use of Python to automate home devices, you can follow these steps:

1. **Set up your development environment**: You need Python installed on your machine, which can be downloaded from the official Python website.
2. **Install necessary libraries**: Use pip to install Flask and requests, as they are the required libraries for creating a web interface and making HTTP requests to devices.
3. **Create a simple Flask application**: This app will serve as the interface for controlling your devices. It should have routes to turn lights on and off.
4. **Create a basic HTML interface**: Create a file named `index.html` in a folder called `templates`. This HTML file should create a simple interface with buttons to control lights.

To make it work, you need to replace the API endpoints specific to your devices with those provided by your device manufacturers. You can do this by checking the documentation of your devices.

Here is an example code for creating a basic Flask application:
```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

# Define routes to turn lights on and off
@app.route('/light/<string:device_id>/on', methods=['GET'])
def turn_light_on(device_id):
    # Replace with the API endpoint specific to your device
    return f"Light {device_id} is turned on"

@app.route('/light/<string:device_id>/off', methods=['GET'])
def turn_light_off(device_id):
    # Replace with the API endpoint specific to your device
    return f"Light {device_id} is turned off"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
To create an HTML interface, you can use a template engine like Jinja2. Create a file named `index.html` in a folder called `templates`. This file should contain the following code:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Smart Home Automation</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/axios@0.21.1/dist/axios.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Smart Home Automation</h1>
    <form id="light-form">
      <button type="submit" id="turn-light-button">Turn Light On</button>
      <input type="text" id="temperature-input" placeholder="Temperature">
      <button type="submit" id="turn-light-off-button">Turn Light Off</button>
    </form>

    <script>
      const axios = require('axios');
      const lightForm = document.getElementById('light-form');

      lightForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const device_id = document.getElementById('temperature-input').value;
        axios.post('/light/' + device_id + '/on')
          .then((response) => {
            console.log(response.data);
          })
          .catch((error) => {
            console.error(error);
          });
      });

      lightForm.addEventListener('submit', (event) => {
        event.preventDefault();
        const device_id = document.getElementById('temperature-input').value;
        axios.post('/light/' + device_id + '/off')
          .then((response) => {
            console.log(response.data);
          })
          .catch((error) => {
            console.error(error);
          });
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
This code creates a basic HTML interface with buttons to turn lights on and off. When the "Turn Light On" button is clicked, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `/light/<device_id>/on` endpoint using Axios. Similarly, when the "Turn Light Off" button is clicked, it sends an HTTP POST request to the `/light/<device_id>/off` endpoint.

To test your application, run the Flask server by executing the Python script and open your web browser. You should see the smart home control interface. Click the buttons to turn lights on and off.

I will provide a comprehensive and detailed answer based on the scraped content.

The question asked "teah me how to swim in a week." 

To address this, we need to analyze the provided content related to swimming. The first piece of relevant information is that it's recommended to swim only once a week for beginners or those who have taken a swimming class and know how to swim. This means that the initial approach will be different from more intense workouts.

The second relevant piece of information is about creating an eight-week plan with three workouts per week, designed for a fairly aggressive progression. The goal is to increase intensity over time, but it's not explicitly stated what activities or exercises should be included in each workout.

To swim only once a week, the following steps can be followed:

1. Warm up: Start by warming up with either a brisk walk (5 minutes) or a gentle swim (5 minutes). Then stretch in the deck or pool to prepare your body for swimming.
2. First workout goal: Build stamina by swimming 100 yards in four segments or lengths, with rests between each length. Rest time is measured in breaths.

The first workout involves swimming 100 yards in four segments, and rest periods are allowed between each segment. It's essential to note that this initial plan focuses on building stamina rather than intense exercise.

Moving forward, the question about how to increase the intensity of the swimming routine over the eight-week period is addressed by providing an eight-week plan with three workouts per week. The specific exercises or activities included in these workouts are not detailed here, but it's mentioned that they should be designed for a fairly aggressive progression.

The following steps can be taken:

1. Progression: Increase intensity every two weeks. For example, if you have reached 2-3 sets of four segments in the initial plan, move on to increasing the distance by 25 yards.
2. New exercises or activities: Include new exercises or activities that target different muscle groups in each workout, such as upper trapezius and levator scapulae (neck and shoulder), pectoralis major and minor (chest), and latissimus dorsi (mid-back).
3. Gradual increase in intensity: Increase the distance by 25 yards every two weeks, or aim for three to five days a week.

The eight-week plan mentioned includes workouts with three sets of four segments, resting between each segment. The exact exercises and activities included are not specified, but it's essential to note that progress will be measured in pool lengths (e.g., 25 yards). 

To summarize, the initial approach is to warm up, then focus on building stamina by swimming 100 yards in four segments with rests between each length. Over time, increase intensity every two weeks, incorporating new exercises or activities that target different muscle groups, and gradually increase the distance by 25 yards in three sets of four segments.

To learn judo in a week, follow these steps:

1. **Watch YouTube tutorials**: Begin by watching 5-6 YouTube videos that cover various aspects of judo, such as basic techniques, stances, and movements.
2. **Practice proper posture and breathing**: Watch videos that demonstrate good posture, breathing, and body positioning during judo exercises. Practice these skills in front of a mirror to improve your technique.
3. **Focus on fundamental movements**: Pay attention to the fundamental movements of judo, such as throws, takedowns, and escapes. Practice these moves regularly to build muscle memory and coordination.
4. **Work with a partner or instructor**: Find an experienced judoka (judo practitioner) who can provide guidance, feedback, and support during your training sessions. They can also help you learn more advanced techniques and strategies.
5. **Be patient and persistent**: Learning judo takes time and practice. Be prepared to spend several hours each week working on your technique, and don't get discouraged if you don't see improvement right away.

Some specific exercises you might want to focus on include:

* Basic stances (uchimata and tsugi-ashi)
* Hand techniques (gatame ashi and kizami)
* Throws and takedowns
* Escape techniques
* Kicking techniques

It's also essential to understand the fundamental principles of judo, such as:

* **Do (iki):** The center line that separates the two sides of the mat. It's your opponent's base of support.
* **Wa (mawashi):** Your opponent's base of attack and defense.
* **Ki (kata):** Pre-determined patterns or techniques that you practice regularly to build muscle memory.

By following these steps, watching YouTube tutorials, practicing proper posture and breathing, focusing on fundamental movements, working with a partner or instructor, and being patient and persistent, you can learn judo in just one week.

To meditate in a week, follow these steps:

1. **Choose a quiet space**: Find a quiet area with few distractions where you can sit comfortably without interruptions. This could be your bedroom, a sun porch, or a quiet den.
2. **Create a calming atmosphere**: Use gentle lighting and a comfortable temperature to create a soothing ambiance.
3. **Sit comfortably**: Choose a sitting position that feels relaxed for you, such as on a cushion, a mat, or a blanket on the floor.
4. **Breathe in and out**: Close your eyes and focus on your breath, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.
5. **Focus on your breath**: Bring your attention to your breath, trying not to let it wander away from your focus.
6. **Continue breathing until the timer rings**: If you're meditating for a certain amount of time (e.g., 2-3 minutes), simply continue breathing until the timer rings, then come back to your thoughts and gently bring your attention back to your breath.

This process can help calm your mind and reduce stress, anxiety, and other negative emotions. Regular practice will allow you to develop greater mindfulness and relaxation skills over time.

Some additional tips to consider:

* Start with short sessions (2-3 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.
* Try meditating at different times of day or in different environments to find what works best for you.
* Be patient and gentle with yourself – it may take some time to develop your focus and calmness.

By following these steps and tips, you can establish a regular meditation practice that brings relaxation, clarity, and well-being into your life.

I'll do my best to provide a comprehensive and detailed answer based on the scraped content.

To meditate in a week requires some planning and commitment, but it's definitely achievable with regular practice. Here are some tips to get you started:

1. **Set aside time**: Allocate 10-15 minutes each day for meditation, ideally at the same time each day.
2. **Find a quiet space**: Identify a quiet and comfortable spot where you can sit without distractions.
3. **Choose a meditation technique**: Experiment with different techniques such as mindfulness, loving-kindness, or transcendental meditation to find what works best for you.
4. **Start small**: Begin with short sessions (5-10 minutes) and gradually increase the duration as you become more comfortable with the practice.
5. **Be consistent**: Aim to meditate at the same time each day, even on weekends or days off, to make it a habit.
6. **Focus on your breath**: Bring your attention to your breath, noticing its sensation, texture, and movement. When your mind wanders, gently bring it back to your breath without judgment.
7. **Be patient**: Meditation is not a one-time event; it's a continuous process that requires regular practice to see results.

In the video, the instructor shares their own experience with meditation and how it has improved their mental health. They also mention that mindful awareness can help reduce stress and anxiety by:

* Increasing self-awareness
* Enhancing emotional regulation
* Improving sleep quality
* Boosting mood

The instructor suggests trying different techniques, such as body scan or loving-kindness meditation, to find what works best for you.

It's worth noting that the video also mentions that Shambhala Meditation Center of Milwaukee offers guided meditations and workshops on their website. If you're interested in learning more about meditation or finding a local center, you can check out their resources.

Overall, meditation is a powerful tool for improving mental health and well-being. With regular practice, you can experience the benefits of reduced stress, improved mood, and increased self-awareness.

I will provide a comprehensive answer to the question "Teach me how to be great dad in a week."

The text provided does not mention anything about teaching someone how to be a great dad, but it does mention some of Sean Combs' (Diddy) personal life and career.

Sean Combs is a successful American rapper, record producer, and record executive who has won three Grammy Awards. He founded his own record label, Bad Boy Records, in 1993.

However, the text does not provide any information about teaching someone how to be a great dad. It only mentions that Sean Combs lost his job as the Sports Cabinet secretary in July after President William Ruto reshuffled his Cabinet and was handed over the sports docket by Kipchumba Murkomen.

It also mentions that Diddy (Sean Combs) took a step back from politics and is now on vacation, along with one of his sons who is on holiday. There is no mention of teaching someone how to be a great dad or what steps can be taken to improve parenting skills.

Therefore, I will say that the text does not provide any relevant information about teaching someone how to be a great dad.

To be a great dad in a week, you need to understand the following:

1. Lead by example - This means modeling the behavior and values you want your children to adopt, such as being patient, kind, and honest.
2. Train up a child in the way he should go - This verse highlights the importance of guiding and training your children, teaching them the ways of righteousness.
3. Bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord - This verse emphasizes the responsibility of a father to provide a nurturing and supportive environment for his children, and to avoid behaviors that would provoke anger and resentment.
4. Show compassion to your children - Just as the Lord shows compassion to those who fear him, you can demonstrate love and mercy in your interactions with your children.
5. Do not embitter your children - Bitterness or discouragement can be devastating for children, so it's essential to avoid behaviors that might cause them to become discouraged.

Additionally, you should prioritize time and effort in nurturing and disciplining your children, understanding the long-term impact of your influence. By following these principles, you can build a strong foundation with your child and shape their lives in ways that will last a lifetime.

There are no new gods for the past 1000 years because the New Gods were split into two planets, New Genesis and Apokolips, which have been at war for thousands of years. The Old Gods died during Ragnarök, a catastrophic event that occurred around 1,000 years ago in both planets. The two planets were once part of the same world called Urgrund, but it was split apart after the death of the Old Gods. As a result, the New Genesis is an idyllic planet with unspoiled forests and mountains, while Apokolips is a nightmarish, polluted dystopia filled with machinery and fire pits, ruled by the tyrannical Darkseid. The two planets were once part of the same world, but they have been at war for thousands of years, resulting in the absence of new gods from this period.

The ancient origins expert stated that there are no new gods for the past 1000 years because of a significant reversal in symbolism. This reversal suggests that an earlier tradition, which was less well-known and comes out of the Sakti Cult, is based on an original feminine deity named Amma. However, this name and meaning have been reversed to accommodate an ambiguous definition by the Dogon as both male and female. Additionally, another important deity would be King of the World, often identified by his followers with a beneficent culture bearer who taught the path to God but eventually experienced a fall and met an untimely demise through torture and murder.

To be effective as a kindergarten teacher, you need to possess certain qualities and skills. First, patience is crucial. Children at this age can be unpredictable and require constant attention. They also have short attention spans, so it's important to keep lessons engaging and fun. Additionally, good communication skills are essential for effectively communicating with parents and managing challenging behavior in the classroom.

In terms of teaching strategies, kindergarten teachers need to create and implement lesson plans that engage young minds and help them develop essential skills like reading, writing, and math. By using creative teaching methods such as storytelling, art projects, and hands-on activities, you can make learning fun for your students while also promoting their cognitive development.

Classroom management is another key aspect of being a kindergarten teacher. You'll need to establish classroom rules and routines that promote positive behavior and create a safe learning environment. This may involve setting up a reward system for good behavior or redirecting disruptive students with gentle reminders or positive reinforcement. Effective classroom management techniques will help you maintain control over the classroom while also fostering a sense of community among your young learners.

Ultimately, being effective as a kindergarten teacher requires a combination of patience, creativity, strong organizational skills, and good communication skills. By possessing these qualities and skills, you can excel in this rewarding career path.

To be effective as a kindergarten teacher in your first month, you should focus on building an authoritative personality and establishing a behaviour management system. This will help create a positive learning environment for your students and allow them to feel motivated to learn.

Firstly, establish a clear and consistent classroom culture by setting high standards and providing positive feedback. This can be achieved by using positive language when correcting behavior and offering incentives for good work. You should also establish a behaviour management system that includes clear rules and consequences for misbehaviour.

Secondly, build an authoritative personality by being confident, well-dressed, and having a strong presence in the room. This will help students feel respected and motivated to learn. It is important to remember that authority figures are not always seen as positive figures, so it's crucial to maintain a professional demeanor while still showing empathy and compassion towards your students.

In addition, establish clear expectations for classroom behaviour and ensure that all students understand what is expected of them. This can be achieved by creating an anchor chart or poster that outlines the classroom rules and consequences.

Finally, engage with your students on a personal level to build strong bonds and motivate them to learn. This can be done by asking questions about their interests, hobbies, or goals outside of class. By showing genuine interest in your students' lives, you can help create a positive learning environment that fosters academic achievement and social growth.

By focusing on building an authoritative personality, establishing a behaviour management system, and engaging with your students, you can create a supportive and motivating learning environment for your kindergarten students.

To be effective as a kindergarten teacher, you should have several key traits:

1. Passion for teaching: Kindergarten is a pivotal year in a child's academic development. It's crucial that your passion for what you do sets the tone for your students' opinion about school and learning.

2. Patience: Small children are unpredictable, and they may test their teacher's patience regularly by being easily distracted or disruptive. You must be able to adjust lesson plans accordingly and not get stressed out over unforeseen issues.

3. Intrinsic motivation: If teaching doesn't ignite the passion inside of a person, then it might not be the right career for them. Patience is a must when teaching kindergarten, especially on days when some students are tired, hungry, or not feeling well.

4. Ability to deal with behavior issues: Kindergarten children can be difficult at times, and you'll need to be able to manage their behavior appropriately. This includes dealing with issues like being overly distracted or disruptive, as well as managing potential behavioral problems from other children.

5. Good communication skills: Parents can be challenging to deal with, especially when they're upset or frustrated. You must have the patience to explain the way things work and ease their minds when they are upset or feeling overwhelmed by the education system.

6. Flexibility: Kindergarten is a year of discovery for young children, and you need to be flexible enough to adapt your teaching approach as needed based on the unique needs of each student in the classroom.

7. Ability to manage your emotions: Teaching can be stressful at times, especially when dealing with challenging behaviors or difficult parents. You must have a good ability to manage your emotions and maintain a calm demeanor under pressure.

8. Creativity: Kindergarten is a year of discovery for young children, and you need to be creative in the ways you teach and engage your students. This includes using play-based learning techniques, hands-on activities, and projects that promote learning through exploration and experimentation.

9. Good interpersonal skills: You'll interact with parents, other teachers, and staff members throughout the year. It's important to have good interpersonal skills to maintain positive relationships and ensure a smooth operation of the school.

10. Ability to reflect on your teaching practice: As you progress in your career as a kindergarten teacher, it's crucial that you continue to reflect on your teaching practices and make improvements based on what you learn from your experiences.

Mushrooms are not plants because they belong to a different kingdom of organisms. Mushrooms are actually fungi, which means they have a unique biological structure that sets them apart from plants. One of the main reasons why mushrooms are classified as fungi is because they obtain nutrients through absorption rather than photosynthesis, like plants do.

Another reason mushrooms don't fit into the plant category is their lack of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants that helps them make food through photosynthesis. Mushrooms, on the other hand, cannot perform photosynthesis and therefore lack chlorophyll.

Lastly, the cell walls of fungi like mushrooms are composed of chitin, not cellulose, which is the main component of plant cell walls. This difference in cell wall composition further solidifies the distinction between fungi and plants.

The best small LLM for agentic capabilities depends on several factors such as the specific task you want to accomplish, the complexity of the task, and the available computing resources. However, based on the information provided in the scraped content, it seems that Hugging Face's Link models are particularly useful for this purpose.

Hugging Face Link models are designed to be smaller and more portable than other large language models, making them ideal for running on local devices or in environments where access to a powerful server is limited. They also offer a range of pre-trained models with varying levels of complexity and capability, allowing you to choose the model that best suits your needs.

For agentic capabilities, Hugging Face Link models like DistilBERT, TinyBERT, MobileBERT, ALBERT, GPT-2, DeciCoder - 1B, Phi-1.5, Dolly-v2-3b, StableLM-Zephyr-3B, DeciLM-7B, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2, Orca-2-7B, Amber, OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base, SOLAR-10.7B-v1.0, and NexusRaven-V2-13B are all suitable options.

In summary, Hugging Face Link models offer a convenient and efficient way to run small LLMs for agentic capabilities on local devices or in environments where access to a powerful server is limited. They provide pre-trained models with varying levels of complexity and capability, allowing you to choose the model that best suits your needs.
